## Project Overview

This project uses **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Sentiment Analysis**, and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to analyze a dataset of beer reviews. The goal is to answer specific questions about beer ratings, user preferences, and brewery performance.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/1-5-million-beer-reviews-from-beer-advocate). It contains the following columns:
- `beer_ABV`: Alcohol by volume (ABV) of the beer.
- `beer_beerId`: Unique identifier for each beer.
- `beer_brewerId`: Unique identifier for each brewery.
- `beer_name`: Name of the beer.
- `beer_style`: Style of the beer.
- `review_appearance`: User rating for the beer's appearance.
- `review_palette`: User rating for the beer's palette.
- `review_overall`: Overall user rating for the beer.
- `review_taste`: User rating for the beer's taste.
- `review_profileName`: Username of the reviewer.
- `review_aroma`: User rating for the beer's aroma.
- `review_text`: Written review by the user.
- `review_time`: Timestamp of the review.

## Analysis Questions

The project answers the following questions using statistical methods, NLP, and ML techniques:

1. **Rank top 3 Breweries which produce the strongest beers?**  
   - Grouped by `beer_brewerId` and calculated the average ABV for each brewery.

2. **Which year did beers enjoy the highest ratings?**  
   - Extracted the year from `review_time` and calculated the average rating for each year.

3. **Based on the userâ€™s ratings, which factors are important among taste, aroma, appearance, and palette?**  
   - Calculated the correlation between `review_overall` and factors like taste, aroma, appearance, and palette.

4. **If you were to recommend 3 beers to your friends based on this data, which ones will you recommend?**  
   - Used weighted ratings to recommend beers based on user preferences.

5. **Which Beer style seems to be the favorite based on reviews written by users?**  
   - Analyzed written reviews using sentiment analysis to determine the most liked beer style.

6. **How does written review compare to overall review score for the beer styles?**  
   - Compared sentiment scores from written reviews with overall ratings.

## Results

### Key Findings
1. **Top 3 Breweries by ABV**: Breweries with IDs `22`, `694`, and `2724` produce the strongest beers.
2. **Highest Rated Year**: The year `2012` had the highest average beer ratings.
3. **Most Important Factor**: `review_aroma` has the highest correlation with overall ratings.
4. **Recommended Beers**: Top 3 recommended beers based on weighted ratings.
5. **Favorite Beer Style**: `American Blonde Ale` is the most liked beer style based on sentiment analysis.
6. **User Clusters**: Users were grouped into 3 clusters based on their review patterns.

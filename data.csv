7.7,64883,1075,Cauldron DIPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4,4.5,4,4,johnmichaelsen,4.5,"According to the website, the style for the Caldera Cauldron changes every year. The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday. The beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.",1293735206

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy yellow/orange color with a half finger of fluffy white head. The head fades to a small layer on top of the pour. Smell: Very light and crisp. I'm definitely picking up the ginger, but it's not overly powerful. There is a slight sweetness from the malt as well. Taste: Very light and refreshing. The ginger shows up right away and then fades towards the finish of the sip. The finish is malty and bread like. Mouthfeel: The body is on the thin side with smooth carbonation and a very dry finish. Overall: This is a light and refreshing beer, but nothing spectacular. The amount of ginger is nice, but I would have liked to have more going on.",1325524659

Ok aromas..mainlly a bit of ginger speice and some bready malt..simple nice Taste very nice indeed..nice spicy ginger backed with slightly caramel maltiness..simple again but i like . Liked the mouthfeel of this one..very forward carbonation which helps the ginger effect and a lingering ginger in the after taste. Overall a simple ginger brew .I liked it",1318991115

Pours a bud light yellow with a tiny white head of small bubbles. The beer is almost as clear as a glass of water with some food coloring in it. Aroma of light ginger, a very light malt aroma but primarily odorless on the malt side. I wouldn't be completely surprised if there were some adjuncts in here because of the lack of underlying malt flavors. Taste is of a light adjunct lager with a dosing of ginger. Not surprising there. This is a light session beer, good for the warmer days of spring / summer. Mouthfeel is extremely light, high carbonation. Overall decent. This would be great if you were drinking beers on draft at the bar with some friends just hanging out. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out though to drink out of a bottle.",1306276018

I like ginger, and it was reasonably cheap compared to the other beers I was looking at. Pours a pale golden color with smallish head. Nose is largely uneventful, some ginger in there, a bit of pear, but mainly normal lager. Taste is pretty good, bringing a bit more of the ginger to the fore. MF was a bit fizzy, not terrible though. Easy drinker, I had no problem finishing the bomber. Interesting, but I probably won't get it again.",1290454503
4.7,52159,1075,Caldera Ginger Beer,Herbed / Spiced Beer,5,3.5,4.5,4,augustgarage,4,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Drie Fonteinen tumbler. Hazy titanium yellow body (which catches the shadows forming a beautiful mysterious gradient) with an incredibly dense pillow of magnolia cream. Heavy persistent head and rich creamy lacing. Pale malt, asian pear, and a hint of citrus in the nose. A vaguely tropical lager... Tastes very much like a well done APA, with a nice balance of pale malt and low hop bitterness. The ginger adds to the refreshing character, but isn't readily detectable at first (lacks any ""bite""). Medium-dry finish - very clean and extremely quaffable. I can imagine hibiscus and beets working in small quantities, though I think they omitted those for this version... Light bodied, pillowy, smooth and moderately carbonated. Don't go into this expecting a ginger beer (despite its name) as it has little in common with that spicy soft drink. This is a wonderful session ale though, and worth seeking out if you are a fan of light yet flavorful lagers. Would obviously go perfectly with sushi.",1285632924
4.7,52159,1075,Caldera Ginger Beer,Herbed / Spiced Beer,4,5,5,4,MadeInOregon,4,"OK, so the only reason I bought this while shopping at Whole Foods was because I've never had a ""ginger beer"" unless it was ginger ALE...and we all know that's not the kind of ""beer"" we're interested in on this site! I was very excited to try this one!... When poured out it looks like a cheapo macro lager at first sight, then the slowly fading head suggests otherwise. The body is crystal clear and is a very light straw color. The head is bright white and slowly dissipates, but is initially quite thick. Smell is adjuncty, but there are slight notes of honey and some kind of herby thing going on...ginger perhaps? Can't really tell. From the smell there is obviously something different about this beer though. It has a unique spicy smell to it and reminds me a lot of basil, not ginger. I really can't quite place everything that I smell, but it is a very nice aroma. Superb fragrance for this beer, though definitely not a ""ginger beer"" based on the smell. The taste is very unique also. It's kind of like a spiced pilsner or kolsch but the ""spice"" is kind of hard to identify. It does not taste like ginger. This beer actually reminds me a lot of Bison's Honey Basil ale. There is some definite astringent burn in the upper throat after swallowing that is no doubt from the ginger, but that is the only ginger I can detect with any certainty. It is only slightly hoppy and malty. This a very enjoyable, very drinkable beer (I could easily drink 2 22oz'ers) but I think it's failing in its claim to be a ""ginger"" beer because I don't smell it, can barely taste it, and can only really detect the ginger's physiological effects of a warm throat and stomach. So, rating this one is hard; I've never had a ginger beer so I don't really know what one ought to taste like...but then again I can't really tell if I'm tasting ginger here or the combination of other things. So confused. My recommendation to you Caldera folks: ADD MORE GINGER! There's obviously enough of a curiosity about this style to not hurt sales if it was strengthened. I for one could handle it.",1283154365

Almost cake-like in its malt aroma, sharply bready with a slight edge of sweetness T: Nice clear malty throat taste, reminds me of strands of complex sugars and grains, ginger is more subtle than I expected, more of an undertone than a backbone M: A refreshing light beer feel, like a pilsner or summer ale D: If this was a sixer instead of a double-deuce, I could see this being a fine picnic pounder Overall, pretty impressed for the particular style",1277557990

S: Great nose of ginger, honey, perfume. T: Rather light upfront, it reminds me of Lawnmower, with a hint of ale fruitiness/Kolsch-like almost. Good ginger honey notes on the back end, not taking over the beer in any way. The ginger flavour is clear, but I wanted it to come out a little more in the end. M: Very light-bodied, watery, light base beer for sure. D: An easy drinking spiced beer, this will offend no one, but there's not a complexity to this brew at all.",1275779250
4.7,52159,1075,Caldera Ginger Beer,Herbed / Spiced Beer,3,4,3.5,3,RangerClegg,4,"Is it possible for a bottle to be a novelty product? I bought it cause it's the only bottle of Caldera I've ever seen, so I guess so. Stoked to be the first to review a beer! That's a lot of responsibility so I might as well give it a thorough review. Poured into my New Belgium Tulip. A - Clear golden color with a bright white 1"" head that slowly fades to a ring around the top. Lacing is minimal, but still there and fighting to cling to the glass S - Smell is of ginger and honey. Very appealing. T - First hit is of ginger. Not too strong or biting but just the right amount. Fades to a sweetness on the tongue that is sort of perfect and then... a little bit of bite from the hops making their presence known. M - Medium bodied and full. A nice round beer for the summer. Not too heavy, definately not watery. Not very good at describing it other than it's good. D - I really like this beer and I could probably put 2 or 3 glasses away, so one bomber is enough for me. I think 2 bombers would be too much, but I could probably drink one and half, so I think I'll have to stick with the one. Overall this is a pretty good ginger beer. I think that for my money though, I'd rather buy Trade Route's Ginger Pale Ale. If you've never had a ginger beer, Pick it up.",1273109020
7.2,10789,1075,Caldera Oatmeal Stout,Oatmeal Stout,2.5,3,3,3,Beerandraiderfan,3,"Brown in color, somewhere between a porter and a brown ale. Lacking in aroma, but no off stuff. Same with the taste, lacking flavor, complexity, just went with smoothness. No off flavors though, so I can't say this is bad, just unadventurous, especially for Caldera, whom I think is generally underrated. You really have to search to pull anything out of this in terms of the usual chocolate/coffee flavors, really, the only thing I can tell is that the oats did their job, because this is smooth and unoffensive.

7.2,10789,1075,Caldera Oatmeal Stout,Oatmeal Stout,2.5,1.5,2,2.5,RedDiamond,2,"Caldera presents yet another circumstance where the brewery does not operate a brewpub, doesnt bottle their beers, and is located 300 miles from my home. To review their beers I traveled to their hometown of Ashland, OR and drank at the Ashland Creek Bar and Grill. This may have been a mistake. Though I had other reasons to visit Ashland, its disappointing (to say the least) to travel 300 miles and be served a spoiled beer. Both the Oatmeal Stout and Ashland Amber were of poor quality at the Ashland Creek Bar and Grill. In the case of the Oatmeal Stout, a nice measure of cream and a wayward thread of mint were marred by a sulfuric smell and likely bacterial infection. Though I cant say for certain, my best guess is that the house tap lines were something other than sanitized. I will attempt to revisit and re-evaluate this beer. But for the time being, its important to ask a pertinent question about quality control. Caldera is a 10 bbl microbrewery in a small town. How much responsibility do they have towards assuring that taps serving their product in their hometown are kept reasonably clean and free of bacterial encroachment? My answer to this question is that the brewery does have some responsibility to assure quality pours in its own hometown. This is especially so when they operate no pub of their own. Not only does this effort protect the consumer from being served a spoiled beer, but the enforcement of quality control measures at the point of consumption simply makes good business sense. Till then, theres nothing I really care say about this beer other than to wish whoever pursues it greater luck than I had at Ashland Creek.",1103502339

Sweet caramel malts surprise me as I thought the smoke would hit hard right off the bat... The smokiness here is beautifully done...

The nose is a smoky, malty blast of barbequed pulled pork, woodsmoke and brown sugar with undertones of baked apples and peaches. Nothing over-the-top here- good balance and elegance in the aromas. And I dunno if it's just me and my mental associations, but I could swear I smelled the BBQ sauce in this too. The palate, much like the nose, is hugely smoky- more bbq and toffee flavors- with a medium-body and a slight creaminess from the malt. The hoppiness is mild while the smoke, naturally, is what lingers on the nice finish. A wonderful effort overall. I wouldn't go so far as to say world class, but the brew does have a nice bit of elegance which always gets more points from me.

I'll leave it at that and hope I don't O.D. off this 22 ounce bottle. On to the beer: The chestnut colored body is a looker in the stange glass. On top, the head has a beige color, a somewhat creamy texture, several groupings of lace sticking around and retention. The rauch part is done extremely well; mouth-watering jerkied meats stand out above with a little sweetness and a kiss of leafy hop. There's a lot of meat on the bones of this beer. Loads and loads and maltiness and medium smokiness make this a winner. The two run in sperate stages and never cross into each other's territory, which in this case I adore. Its got the smokiness that I would find in a summer sausage. On the malty side, there's loads of caramel. Little notes of ash give me the impression that I'm at a campfire. Hints of brown sugar. Alcohol slowly gets noticed, but in a good way; here it brings notes of raisin. There is a moderate hoppiness that can be sensed for a brief second, catch it before the smoke and malt beat it down. On the fuller side in terms of mouthfeel, quite smooth with the bubbles very small yet enough to be felt. If I hadn't stuffed myself with Chinese food earlier in the night, I may have been more tempted to overdose on Rauch Ur Bock. Only kidding, I have a good idea when to stop. Warning, you may be temped buy more bottles after you try your first. In short, superb.",1306128988

Not the smokiest or most pungent smoke profile I've experienced, but damn up there. and I think it's the intense rich malt and sweetness from the malt that keeps the smoke slightly tamed. A touch of lemon and citrus fruitiness in the finish which blends perfectly with the cherry smoke. It's not as crisp or dry as other Rachbiers, and it seems a bit more full-bodied, with almost a touch of syrupiness to it. which is kind of an interesting take on it. I'm digging it. I'm not usually one to say this, but it's almost a touch malt-forward. Not that it's a bad thing.

Smell is smokey and sweet. Both cherry and beechwood were used, but I'm getting mostly cherry in the nose. Taste is really quite smokey, the beechwood really asserting itself here, although the sweetness of the cherry wood and the malt is no slouch either. The smoke has a sharp phenolic quality that I get from peat, but with the sweetness I think it works well. Note it's not cloying, the sweetness is enjoyable and provides relative balance. Mouthfeel is slick, some softness, a medium bodied, and smooth. Nice. Drinkability is really quite good for such a smoke bomb. No doubt inspired by Aecht Schlenkerla, with the body and color of the marzen, but the punch of the ur bock, it one of the best stateside examples of the style, which is rarely attempted and even more rarely successful.

If I had to reach for some balance there is a faint raisin type sweetness buried in the finish. Notes: I'd be interested to see exactly how they brewed this beer.

Sweet stone fruits and a touch of orange zest add their nuances to the flavor. Its more complex than I usually find smoked beers to be and I can really enjoy it! Semi-thin in body with fine prickly carbonation is a nice contrast to such a powerful flavor profile. Anything heavier may have been too much. Finishes clean.

It's not overly smoky, which is a positive thing in that it allows some of the other delicate scents and flavours to shine. Of those, I pick up on a light - but noticeable - fruitiness, both in nose and on the palate that seems a little odd. worth note: after writing the above, I noticed the print on the side of the bottle to see that cherry wood is used in addition to beechwood. That would explain the fruitiness noted. M + D: Body feels a little lighter in the mouthfeel, but seems to pick up a little weight after going down, however little sense that might make.

Earthy and slightly piney with bitter sappy sugar.. The bittering is not high, but there is little aroma hopping evident or much malt complexity either. This is a very light pale ale with little going on beyond some bittering hops, leaving a slightly floral but vegetal finish. An okay beer for a local brewpub, but not quite up to the standard of most pale ales in distribution. Light bodied, creamy, lots of smooth bubbles. A simple beer, but not really in a good way.

The hops are highly bitter and pretty harsh: a little more floral and citrus character would blend better with the ambiguous malting. Motwithstanding, this is an above-average APA without a doubt.

Ooooh yeah, cracking open a can sounds good!! a thick, solid and rocky -white head stands proud like Mt. shasta itself over a bright plae golden liquid, much like the N.Cali sunsets. Retention is amazing, it's not going anywhere anytime soon. The nose is just bursting with hoppy cascade aroma's!! Sweet fruits, musty herbs, wheat and corn and light but sweet malt. This all cascade beauty has a great aroma. The hoppy flavor's here are deep and very complex, cascade hoppiness all in my face. Light and very, very crispy feel is exciting and spot-on for the style. crisp with a creamy smooth finish from the beastie foam still clumping it's way down slow. The cascade hops provide a gentle fruitiness and perfect dry-herbal and earthy complexity. I havn't been this excited for a Pale ale since my very first Sierra Nevada!!(circa 1996) This pale ale in a can has made my day, and I'm camping in one of the most pristine locations I've ever been too.

Pretty good retention and lacing. Fairly strong citrusy hop bouquet with a pleasant mild sweetness and biscuity malt. Smells like it will be a crisp, dry brew. And so it proves to be. There's a bit of honeyish sweetness up front, but it's immediately bullied around by a tag team of citrus (orange zest and grapefruit) and sharp pine needle flavors. There's a bit of earthiness in there, too. The sweetness dries up torward the finish as the citrus is joined by some pine needles for a sharp sting of bitterness and a rather 'scratchy' mouthfeel. After a couple of seconds, the bitterness is chased away by a crisp snap of biscuity malt. Carbonation is lively, and the beer starts off as seemingly medium-bodied, but 'fluffs up' in to something pretty substantial. Overall impression: Excellent APA. Bold and flavorful, yet incredibly drinkable.",1246835039

5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4,4,4,4.5,CrellMoset,3.5,"Can from Beer Run, Charlottesville, VA, enjoyed on site during Super Bowl Sunday. Poured into a traditional American pint glass that came chilled, so I had to give it a chance to warm and wipe it down. Appearance: Pours a surprisingly light and transparent golden yellow - I'm hesitant to say urine, but, you know - with an initially foamy two-finger head that fades into a relatively healthy sheen pretty quickly and leaves lots of scraggly, fluffy, cloud-like lacing streaming upwards towards the rim. The collar if thick and fluffy, though light looking. A solid start. Aroma: Buttery, slightly spicy malt notes, cracker and biscuit-like, with a few light fruity esters - perhaps hoppy in origin, perhaps yeasty in origin, coming across as pineapple in places - mingling with some heavier, definitively hoppy citrus notes, and plenty of grassy, spicy notes. Perfectly pleasant. Taste: Very balanced for a pale ale, almost ESB like. The malt profile here is large and in charge, very graham cracker/biscuit like, perhaps slightly buttery in places. Malt bitterness is mild to perhaps moderate, slightly herbal and grassy, lacking a lot of those good west coast hop notes that I'd like out of, well, a west coast hopped ale. It's almost cinnamony in places, probably a result of the hop notes. Odd but interesting. Mouthfeel: Incredibly smooth and soft, gently carbonated, leading to a very creamy and subtle mouthfeel, a feel which works well with the malt profile on this one. Very very nice. Drinkability: This was a strange and somewhat unexpected brew. Not quite your traditional west coast pale ale, heavy on the bitterness, citrus, and minty hops with a heavily roasted but still sweet malt backbone to back it up; this one is more heavy on lighter, spicier, grassy hop notes and has a surprisingly light and dry malt foundation. Nonetheless, it's still nice, pleasant, and went well with the first six minutes of SuperBowl XLIII!",1233532055

Very nice floral hop aroma. Lots of cascade with the underlying citrus aroma. Nice little caramel malt aroma but it is definitely hop dominant. Golden but cloudy. Pours with a thick pure white head that ends up as a half inch layer of rocky bubbles. Just a little bit of rising bubbles in the glass. Pretty good lacing. Nice caramel malt flavor right off and then it has a good hop bitter bite. Mostly grapefruit citrus hops. Can says that it is all cascade so that makes sense. Finish is also some caramel malt flavor. In between there is some oily hop flavor too. Pretty much exactly what I'm looking for in a west coast PA. Hoppy but with enough malt that it isn't unbalanced. Medium bodied with a good medium carbonation level. Not heavy at all. very nice on my palate. Very nice beer. I wouldn't rave about to my beer geek friends it but I would be happy to have it as a regular in my fridge. Solid everyday drinking type beer.,1215388875

At first glance this beer is a bit lighter than Dale's but remains a very good looking beverage, pouring a slightly hazed golden color with a large white head that lasts a while and leaves very impressive lacing. Nose is very hoppy and bitter, quite a bit of citrus noticeable. More sweet and less toasted malt than the Dale's. I'd have a hard time deciding on a favorite between the appearance and aroma, but very slightly prefer the taste I had yesterday - both probably should rate about a 4.25. Caldera is more bitter - that isn't a bad thing - and has a noticeably dryer finish. Body is on the light side of medium - seems slightly thinner than Dale's - while carbonation is crisp and appropriate. Final verdict?

I noticed no oxidation whatsoever. It poured a just-slightly-hazy golden body beneath a short head of frothy white foam. The head dwindled down to a creamy surface covering, and then shrank away to a wide collar and whispy surface covering; leaving behind tiny-spotted walls of lace. Bright hops, sweetish malt, and yeasty fruitiness greeted me in the nose, expressing soft citrus, sweetish grainy malt, berries, and cut-grass. It's soft carbonation and medium-light body left it remarkably smooth across the palate. The flavor delivered a rich maltiness upfront that wasn't quite caramelish or toasty, but headed there; followed by an influx of grassy and citrusy hop flavors; and then some berry-like fruitiness at the swallow. The bitterness roses up strong, and although some sticky malt lingered in the mouth, it was bitter, dry, grassy and spicy in the finish. It lingered momentarily with some strength, and then faded to a dull bitterness, leaving me ready for another sip. Quite the little charmer, I say! I love the flavor transition from quaint, sweetish, straight-forward and non-caramelish maltiness, to bold, grassy, citrusy, and bitter hops!!!

I'm all about the canned craft beer movement - bring it! Appearance is crystalline straw color, very light amber. Definitely meets the pale criteria. Not much head, and it dies down quickly, though there is a constant stream of bubbles and some nice sticky lace. Nose is fantastic, a huge whiff of those cascades mentioned on the can. Juicy aroma for sure. Flavor doesn't live up to the nose. The malts to back up the hop flavors are lacking, so this ends up being very dry. Decent hop bitterness, but not a very distinctive hop character. Lacks the roundness of some of the better pales. Mouth is decent, pretty light with some brightness, but with enough body.

The attractive, cream colored head looks to be high in hop oils; at least I hope so. The glass residue is so fine and spider web-like that it resembles actual lace. Drinking this beer out of the can and missing an appearance like this should be a criminal offense. The nose is outstanding (see 'drinking... can... criminal offense' above) and puts a huge number of IPAs to shame. The pithy pungency of the Cascade hops fairly leaps out of the glass, with the overall aroma made deeper and more interesting by a much lesser quantity of spicy Perle hops. Great job Caldera. Even if the flavor is on the pedestrian side, the nose is a world-class sprinter. The flavor doesn't measure up to those stratospheric heights, but that's not to say this isn't a deliciously hoppy pale ale. Emphasis on hoppy. The brewers made sure their beer would last a good, long while by packaging it in light-rejecting aluminum and by adding an impressive amount of hops. Sweet, spicy and juicy white grapefruit is front, center and back. I love the slight variation on the usual Pacific NW flavor profile that the German hops provide. APAs don't need to be complex to suit me (this one isn't), they just need to be bursting with pale malt-supported bitter hoppiness (this one is). There's enough sweetness on hand to keep things kinda, sorta balanced from a hophead's perspective, although the pucker factor is still decidedly high. The mouthfeel is light-medium and perfectly carbonated; the better to down a few cans on a hot summer day without a second thought. Caldera Brewing Company is anything but a household name (unless one lives in Ashland, Oregon or its environs), but this little brewery has just provided me with the best beer that I've ever had out of a can.

Medium to medium-high level of bitterness that maintains its posture into the dry finish. Medium-light in body with a moderate carbonation. Smooth. Overall another solid offering from Caldera.

5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4,3.5,3.5,3.5,BEERchitect,4,"Well balanced between caramel maltiness and citrusy hops, this beer exemplifies the Pale Ale style nicely. An expected deep golden to light copper color does the beer pour. Froathy head character amounts to an inch or so before settling it's white lace on the glass. Good retention, but great on lacing. A classic Pale Ale appearance. Caramel, spice, and hops blend in the nose for the impression of graham crackers, orange rinds, and a touch of ginger. Very appealing aroma that doesn't let the hops nor the malt gain precidence. Sweet maltiness sets the tone for taste with a medium caramel flavor, cracker-like breadiness, and a light grainy or crusty taste that gives a slight bite that ushers in the hop flavor and bitterness. Grapefruit, orange zest, and light grassy notes peak through early, but grow in intensity until the malt sweetness waivers, giving the finish and aftertaste a decidedly bitter ending to an otherwise balanced beer. Malt sweetness gives a fuller, rounder sensation to the mouth, while the hops and moderate alcohol provide a drying and crispening finish. Though not complete in dryness or crispness in finish, the beer holds onto enough malt character to attempt balance deep in the finish and aftertaste. With relatively low/no flaws in execution, the recipe formulation leads to a somewhat one-dimentional caramel malt sweetness that wears on the palate and hurts the sessionability of the beer. And with the standard malt/hop balance, there's not much intrigue to keep me comming back.",1296194634

Flavor- Nice balance from start through the middle and into the finish with soft caramel/burnt sugar maltiness and a hearty pungent citrusy vein of hop goodness. Bitterness and hop pungency intensifies into finish and lingers well beyond the exhale with a kiss of cracker-like light malt. Very refreshing, crisp, and edgy pale ale!

Big hops, but nice dose of flavor, aroma, and bitterness in there. Just the right amount of malt sweetness to keep drinkability high.

I was assured by the proprietor that this was fresh. Looks wonderful in my pint glass. Serious 2 finger head that sticks around and around. When it does subside, a beautiful lace is left behind. The beer is orange with some gold highlights. Agitation brings it back at full force. A great start. Smell is average, unfortunately. Some citrus hops and some pale malt. But not as pronounced a boquet as I would ask for. What's there is orange, sweet marmelade on biscuits, and caramel. Taste is also just not cutting it. Looking at my experience rating APA's, I've had several that just pack more flavor and in more creative ways. Great Lakes Burning River and Three Floyds Alpha King blow this away. However this is decent. My biggest issue is that the citrus-backed bitterness and the sweet kiss of honey and bread crust from the malt just fall short of anything more than the average. Mouthfeel is above average thanks to the adequate, smooth carbonation and medium body. Finish is wonderful with just a touch of lingering bitterness. Very drinkable as well, I'd like to try it from the source sometime to see what's it's like when maximum freshness is assured. When it surfaces in Ohio, it just lacks the depth and punch I like in my APA's.",1280773118
5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4,3.5,5,5,ThreeWiseMen,4,"Poured into a 7oz. snifter. Appearance: Poured out quite nicely: produced one finger's worth of fluffy, off-white head, which came to rest atop a crystal clear, golden body. Faint streams of carbonation did their best to keep that head up, but it eventually faded to a sticky crown. Bubblebath-like lacing trailed the beer all the way to the bottom of the glass. Nice. Smell: Pineapple + cat pee = Simcoe. Those are the two aromas I got right off the bat. Pine bark, wholegrain toast, and lime also pulled through. If I could guess, I'd say the hop bill includes late additions of Simcoe and Amarillo hops. Not bad, but not what I typically prefer in a pale either. Taste: Whole grains, butter and dough form a lovely malt backbone. Lemon zest accents that backbone, while woody hops create a bold, bitter aftertaste. Not sure how old this can is, but I love the malt-hop balance, which is tilted just a bit toward the malty end of the spectrum. Mouthfeel: Caldera Pale Ale's active yet soft, rolling carbonation massaged my palate for the entire session. The body is light, crisp, and very refreshing. To top things off, the beer finishes bitter but not too dry, and leaves a flavorful, long-lasting aftertaste. It don't get any better than this. Perfect! Drinkability: The more I drink this, the more it reminds me of New Belgium's Ranger IPA (in a pale ale form, of course). I didn't expect a whole lot out of this one going in, but I finished it in a flash! Will definitely buy more if I come across it again.",1280377901

The more craft beers that come in cans, the more the stigma that surrounds canned beer will fade away--plus, there is no debate about sunlight and bottle color. That dead horse has been beaten way too much. Thin tiny-bubbled lace forms from a moderate pour, retention is fine and the lace stays around for most of the session. Brilliant golden color shimmers in the light. Flowery citric hop aroma screams Cascade hops, bit of biscuity malt with a mild caramel sweetness in the nose. Light to medium body with just as much smoothness and crispness, both with ample amounts for the semislick mouthfeel. Minty and earthy yet mainly citric-flavored hop draws in a lot of flavor with a solid bitterness. Very clean palate with bread notes, almost grassy graininess in the middle. Hop bitterness digs in deep but does not go too far to throw anything out of balance. Cascade hops are all over the finish with an earthy citric flavor. Ends with a touch of dry maltiness. A benchmark ale for PNW Pale Ales, if not American Pale Ales altogether, and that benchmark is not of modest stature. It shows great balance without the Cascade smack taking over, clean and very drinkable. The last of the sample was paired with a plain goat cheese and Pink Lady apples--very nice.",1278462434

My first brew from Caldera, there seems to be a kind of obsession with the number 60 on the can that I'm not ""getting"". It pours a clear light golden colour, good 2 finger head of foam, looks to have some good lacing. The smell is big citrus hops and an equally big nose of grain, not so good, and some honey, which is nice. Ok, now the grain surpasses the hops and everything else and I'm saying what? I have mixed feelings on the smell, which, don't get me wrong, isn't bad, it ends up being good. The taste is a battle between the hoppy bitterness which is, really, a nice light citrus combined with some pine, and a strong grainy flavour that for me, seems out of place for an APA. Hell yes, I like a good malty presence in the style but I'd rather have some sweet caramel taste to balance the hops than an all out frontal attack of grain and grain is what is distracting me. To no good end. Dang. On the high end of light bodied, lowish level of carbo. The mouthfeel is just fine. Drinkability? I've noticed after further sipping that the combination of the hops and grain make for an undesirable, to me, bitterness in the finish so...I'm glad this is only 12oz.

5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4,3,4.5,4,Rmassimiano,5,"Appearance : The beer pours an extremely clear yellow leaning on the golden/orange side. The head that appeared looked like clouds forming, the color of the foam was pure white it looked like a nice layer of clouds hovering on top of the liquid. Aroma: There is not a whole lot of aroma but can smell a slight hint of citrusy hops. Mouthfeel: It has that dry astringent taste that some wines or teas leave behind. Flavor: This is something I really enjoy with pale ales or IPAs. Really bitter for a regular Pale Ale which is surprisingly a good thing. As I keep drinking it tastes more and more malty but definitely has the hops bitterness right up front above all else. Overall Impression: I nice hoppy bitter Pale Ale. I usually say why drink a regular pale if you can go for the India, but this I would drink again if given the option between other pale ales.",1256089931

Malt is toasty and slightly sweet; hops are mostly earthy, with a little spice and a little floral character. This beer is unbalanced toward the hop side of the scale, but not overly so. All in all a pretty good pale. Mouthfeel: pretty solid medium body with an appropriate level of carbonation. I like it.

5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4,4,4.5,4,RoyalT,4,"Appearance - This is a light and bright orange in color with a modest head that showed great retention. Smell - This is an even combination of nice grain and fruit-juicy hops. The citrus hops are very intense and at first appear to be overtaking the nose but then the grain proves to be a bit more stubborn. Together they form a fair balance and a beautiful APA bouquet. Taste - The hops are more forward at the taste but the grain holds its own. It's easy to wax on about the hops because they are big and exceptional, but I'm going to talk about the grain here a bit. They are light for sure but show a sharpness not often found in the style. This IMO allows the hops to stand out without being overbearing. Mouthfeel - This is bigger than a light lager but not medium-bodied. There's a bitterness here that is somewhat mild but forceful in that it finds its way throughout the mouth from beginning to end. Drinkability - I was very impressed with this Caldera can. The style usually is not one to stand out but this effort is an exception.",1254099708

The head is rocky w/ a fine bead, light haze (hops) w/ light lace that collects like dripping paint streaks S - More pine scents from hops than anything but full of aroma all the same w/ mild malt accent and hint of floral aroma M - The feel is medium w/ crisp effect of sufficiently bitterness, medium carbonation w/ mellow toasted notes and a semi-dry finish w/ mild alcohol in the feel T - The crispness of the flavor in the malt is noted and followed immediately by a pine + citrus hop taste. The bitterness is prominent and subsides gradually into a light toasted note like baked biscuits which is well blended under layers of bitter tasting spicy pepper and pine. The flavor has a mild citrus pinch in the finish w/ more rind taste than flesh of fruit. The bread crumb-like malt taste is trailing w/ dry leafiness and mild alcohol as it finishes D - A bitter pale mainly to put it lightly, more like a light IPA.

S= Slight coffee roastiness mixed with treacle-like sweetness combine to make a rich aroma. T= Extremely tasty porter here. Started off as a battle between slightly bitter roasted malts and the sweetness of the caramel malts. Some earthiness and dark fruit esters creep in to add complexity midway. Finish was medium dry - sort of an extension of the same taste battle. MF= Medium bodied with just the right ""medium"" carbonation for the style. Refreshing without being sharp on the tongue.

This is a great neighborhood bar, with a fine, if not huge selection of beer, and deserves some spillover beer geek traffic once the Clinton Street Theater's brewpub opens down the street. Anyway, the porter is lighter than your typical porter black, more of a transparent ginger brown. The head is small but the lacing is determined. The aroma is mild rainy day, and the flavor profile contains deep caramel, light smokiness, cured meat, cola, and a tart herbal quality that masks the malt sweetness.

8.1,58920,1075,Vas Deferens Ale,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,4,3,3.5,3.5,BuckeyeNation,3.5,"Pecan shell dark brown that becomes burnt orange and dark cherry red with backlighting. Appropriate color for a BSDA. The good looking lid of golden khaki is not Belgianesque... nor was it expected to be. Thick streamers of sudsy lace means no real negatives. I'm not getting much in the way of Belgian yeast esters in the nose, which makes me think the brewers used dark candi sugar, but not Belgian yeast, and called it a day. Not getting the blood orange zest either, just some dark malts. Vas Deferens Ale is the first Caldera brew that I haven't enjoyed immensely. While it isn't bad beer, it's a sorry excuse for a BSDA no matter how you slice it. The flavor profile does not fit the style, not least because there still isn't much contribution from the yeast... which is what should be driving this car. Specifics include toasted pumpernickel, medium-dark fruit, black tea, black pepper and a modicum of citrus zest. That last one isn't immediately recognizable as orange, blood or otherwise. Warming brings a bit more boldness and definition, which is enough to tilt the score in an upward direction. Good sweet-bitter balance and skilled alcohol masking help too. Since nothing else about this brew is Belgianesque, it would unfair to ask the mouthfeel to be. It has neither the medium-full creaminess, the expansiveness, nor the hang-on that it needs to earn the 4.0. Unless you have a passing familiarity with human anatomy and physiology, it's probably best that you don't know what the singing devil on the rather disturbing label is being showered with.

LOL ... we're OK now. It's a dark and heady brew. Brown sugar, medicinal phenols, bubble gum and ripe fruit make for a Belgian-like aroma. It is crisp and smooth with a bitty mouth- feel. Suggestions of chocolate, oranges, toasted bread and rum come to mind. With modest hops, the alcohol is very prevalent; lots of ripe tropical fruit in tow. Bitter orange wins over the blood orange zest. This beer is not half bad, and certainly worth a try if you can get past the label.",1294716213

The beer has smells of alcohol, citrus, and heavy malts, but all well blended together. The beer has a robust burst of flavors, again well blended like the smell. There are flavors of malt, sweetness, citrus/orange, and a little bit of molasses undertone. It's impressive that these bold flavors all blend so well, and the beer still manages to be smooth in mouth. There is an alcohol tinge to the flavor, and it is rather pleasant along with the rest of the beer. There is a very smooth finish, as well, and the beer is surprisingly easy to drink despite all the strong flavors and the decent ABV. Pretty decent brew, and it's unfortunate that this is a rare release. I think this could be a decent flagship beer for the brewery. If it weren't for the sticker price, I would bring home a lot of this one.",1292542146

It smells of oranges, chocolate, nutty malts and it strangely smells a bit like cherries. It tastes strongly of oranges. The orange flavor almost has a fresh taste to it. The malt taste to the beer is a bit nutty and chocolate like. There is a noticeable amount of Belgian yeast flavor. I get a tangy almost chalky flavor from the yeast. The yeast also seems to add some fruity characteristic to the beer. This most orange tasting beer I have ever had. They must have added a lot of orange zest to the beer. The carbonation is medium low in this beer. It has a smooth carbonation to it. The drinkability is pretty good for the how high it is in alcohol. The beer has a smooth flavor so it is quite easy to drink. Overall, a distinctive creative ale that has some minor flaws but overall is a nice tasting beer.

It's seems to be amply carbonated, but the small head quickly dissipates leaving little lacing. The nose is a little flat. Given the description on the bottle, I was expecting something unique and layered, but I could have mistaken this for Newcastle (sorry NC fans). You can pick up a bit of the orange, but given that the label mentions orange was added, you're smelling for it. The flavors are a bit more pronounced than the scent, but they're perhaps less interesting. You're met with roasted malts and orange, but the flavors don't pop, at all, and they're combined with muddy, earthy tones that becomes cloyingly sweet as the sip progresses. This beer needs something else. Hops, perhaps? Perhaps not, it's simply unbalanced. Given the wispy head, I wasn't expecting a lot of viscosity and I wasn't surprised. This is light on the tongue and not in a good way, especially for an 8% Belgian. I've noticed some 'chewy' references here - maybe I got a bad bottle? Possibly, but I'm not sure bad batches/bottles change the body much, and this is pretty damn thin for 8% This beer clearly doesn't work and it's not something I would seek out again, but it doesn't fail - it's not the worst thing I've tried and I like what they were trying to do here.

T: The orange is there with a heavy chocolate flavor and creamy stout characteristics that are very prevalent (roasty and malty). Not as strong of a flavor as the look and ABV would suggest. M: Medium bodied but on the lighter side for this style of beer. Mellow carbonation with a spicy bight. D: Looks like it would be an intense beer, but it's actually smooth and easy to drink.

Small 1/4"" of light beige head, infinitely replenished by a steady stream of healthy carbonation. The aroma is a complex blend of coffee, toasted wood, dark cocoa, burnt sugars and something like raisins and rum. Exactly how a beer called ""Old Growth"" should smell. Bold. This is a big bold beer and yet is incredibly balanced. Flavor is of chocolate, licorice, burnt marshmallows, coffee and Dr. Pepper (I mean that in the best way possible). None of these are subtle but they all compliment each other without any one stealing the show. Appropriately bitter, solid booze with a syrupy finish. This was a great beer and totally unexpected. Big and balanced, a great nightcap or cigar beer (blasphemy!). Enjoyable now or ready to cellar. Highly recommended.",1301032260

T: Roast, cocoa, coffee, lighter hops with earthy feel. Good beer. Not spending much time here, but this is really good. M: thick and syrupy. Like a good beer should be in this genre.

It's drinkable, but only as it warms to room temperature.

The taste holds notes of bitter dark chocolate, roasted malts, light molasses, coffee, licorice and a dash of chocolate syrup. A touch of what could be very light smoke flickers in the distance.

Smell is big on the caramel, honey, sweeter for a stout, but clearly one nevertheless. The lavender creeps out a bit as it warms, although this was so delicious, I didn't give it much chance to do so! Taste is big, loads of complexity of this one, all the adjuncts combine with the chocolate and roast flavors of the malt to remind me of a really fancy truffle. I particularly enjoyed the lingering taste of the pink peppercorns. For so much complexity from the adjuncts, none of them are over done. Smooth, clean,well executed and exceptionally good. Mouthfeel is slick, medium-light bodied, surprisingly, but not in a thin way, just not thick and heavy. Drinkability is good, this is a really nice RIS, super unique. Crazy flavorful, yet smooth and dangerously drinkable. I'm really digging the lavender the most, I can picture myself in Brussels's Grand Plaza eating fancy chocolate, awestruck.

S: Malty sweet nose of fudgy chocolate, mild vanilla, candied fruit and a vague woodiness. Intriguing floral aroma, perfumed with lavender. T: Big chocolate and an astringent coffee roast hit right upfront; sweeter notes of vanilla, even maple syrup, follow. Lots of grain, mild fruit (say, earthy blackberries?), and a fair amount of piney woodiness. LOVE the spiced honey flavor! M: Lots of grit and grain fill the mouth, stick on the teeth.

8.8,20818,1075,Old Growth Imperial Stout,Russian Imperial Stout,4.5,4,4,4,RedDiamond,4,"It's helpful to know something of what you're drinking in advance of drinking it. I knew Old Growth was an imperial stout, but I wasn't aware it was brewed with licorice, honey, chocolate, lavender, and pink pepper corns. So when I drew the snifter to my nose and inhaled its essence, I was caught off guard by its peculiar tapestry of fragrances. I kept wondering if the beer wanted to smell and taste as it did, or if bad luck was conspiring against it. I concluded that Old Growth suffered from no unintended intrusions, but I was still perplexed by its uncommon design. I found Old Growth on tap at the Fort George Public House in Astoria where it was featured among other notables as part of Stout Month. Fort George was serving it in 12-oz. snifters where its panoply of sharp aromas was ably focused. Chocolate flavor was featured abundantly, yet the fragrance was also enhanced by a spice mix suggesting mint. The taste worked parallel to this and I was convinced I was drinking a chocolate mint elixir - pure girl scout cookie. Old Growth's body is oily black with sepia froth. Its complexity makes it an anomaly in a snifter but a year of aging at least tempers this with some smoother contours. I came to enjoy it, but it's clearly not for everyone. 10.3% ABV.",1202674258

The aroma was very bright and fresh cascade hops, behind which lay a few fruity esters. The taste was really nice, my kinda of hoppy beer. Sure, there was a bitter backbone on the finish, but only as much as necessary to keep it balanced. This was all about the citrus and floral notes of the finishing/dry hops, nicely complimented by lots of stone fruit, particularly apricot. The malt, like the bittering hops, only served to keep the sweetness and check and relatively balanced. This is the hoppy NW brew I'd been waiting for, and I'm glad found it! The mouthfeel was medium light bodied with lively carbonation. The drinkability of this was very high for me. I had two over dinner, it went well with steamed clams, raw oysters and steelhead.

Just as word about this beer reached me before I could drink it, so too, the fine aromatic fragrance of bright floral hops leapt out at me from the glass before I could take a sip. Its not surprising that a dry hopped beer should carry such a resounding hop fragrance. Still, the vitality of the aroma was compelling. And the hops were not limited to a mere fragrance.

Palate is mild sweet malt up front, with notes of biscuit, light brown sugar, and just a touch of fruitiness. A very slightly chalky bitterness appears briefly before the swallow, with the finish leaving a mild, stone-fruit sweetness lingering for a few moments.

S- This has your typical lager yeast smell. There is a bready, earthy, grainy and gritty smell. Very rounded and bold smells in terms of beer of this style. T- The beer is crisp and refreshing. I'm getting a big grain taste that is like chewing on the top of a barley stalk. More like the smell of when a grain truck dumps its freshly harvested barley load into the grain grate to be weighed and priced, take that smell and put it as a taste and that's what I'm getting.

Good news is if I ever want this flavor again, I have a large rose bush in my front yard. Undercarbonation leads to an even worse experience. My first drain pour in quite a while.

S- Oh boy, this isn't good. As my buddy whom this bomber was shared with put it, ""One time I puked up a bunch of Cheetos, this smells like that...""- While I agree this was very displeasing, I was able to pick out a few herbal notes. This reminded me of a crappy floral tea. I got the rose petal here and there, but it wasn't in a nice delicate aroma; it was more in your face and mixed with DMS. T/M- Not very good. I tried to give this a chance but I couldn't find what they were going for on this. It is all malt with no hops presented in any way, shape, or form. I wonder if they 100% replaced the hops with rose petals? Thats what it somewhat tastes like; though the rose petals still aren't prominent or pleasing to the palate. There just wasn't any saving grace to this beer; it's a shame. O- I hate to say it, but this was a drainpour by both of us that shared the bomber. We tried, I think I did more than he; but in the end neither could stand to go on.

Head pours healthy and then fades to a thing foam. Really great looking. Nose really doesn't jump out at me. Pale malt tones with a tea-like herbal tone to it. Really nothing noticeable, and that includes the rose. It tastes similar to the nose. There is a floral tone to it. Not hoppy floral but like an herbal tea floral. It's difficult to describe. Luckily, I happened to have a bottle of rose water around so I took a sniff of it and I just couldn't make the connection. The beer as a blonde ale is really very solid. The pale malts work wonderfully with the carbo to create an extremely refreshing beer. This would have been nice to have during those 95+ dog days of summer . Overall, it is a solid beer.

I can pick out the rose petals, but I'm not getting rose water. Flavor is actually just a well made (yet big boned) blonde.... pretty malty from front to back with a lingering finish that makes me think of the backyard roses.. but I am honestly having a hard time pulling it out.. the rose water really only shines about 5-10 seconds after the sip goes down the gullet.

6.1,10784,1075,Caldera IPA,American IPA,4.5,4,4,3.5,BEERchitect,3.5,"Stradling the fence of an American Amber Ale and an IPA, this beer definately has a sweet side. Pouring a firm amber color and with brilliant clarity, the beer carries an impressive foamy off-white head, retains well, and laces even better. A quentessential IPA look, but even a mild haze would have been alright. Caramel richness and piney, grassy, citrusy scents swirl for a somewhat succulent but pungent and sharp hop scents adorn the rim for a balanced and inviting aroma. Flavors of sun kissed barley malt, deep caramels (almost toffee) and bread crust give a much richer malt contribution to flavor than I'm used to in an IPA. But the hop allow for a zesty flavor of grapefruit, orange zest, fresh cut grass, and spruce that are signature IPA flavors. With no off flavors, esters and phenols to a minimum the beer is well brewed- but the malty rich recipe gives me reason to ponder. Sweetness in taste result in a creamier and richer body. Creaminess early lingers well into the mid palate and finish before the hops and alcohol force a terse dryness very very late. A very good beer but the caramel sweetness makes the beer attempt balance where IPA's should be the showcase for hop flavor, aroma, and bitterness. Maltiness also interferes with the body and hinders the crisp and dry attributes needed for greatness in the style.",1294116253

I drank them all out of the can so I can't really go into any detail on the beer's appearance, so i just averaged it with the rest of the critique. A: I'm sure it was good. S: Sweet and grassy with a bit of malt, but the hops really dominate which is nice. T: Nice grassy kinda piney hop bight right off the bat with some grapefruit flavor in there too, then mellows a bit which allows the maltiness to come through at the end. M: Medium bodied but on the lighter side of medium, mellow carbonation but not under-carbonated by any means, someone used sticky to describe the mouthfeel and that's a real good way to describe it.

6.1,10784,1075,Caldera IPA,American IPA,4.5,4,4,3,cvaypai,4.5,"Poured from can to my New Belgium globe. Thanks to Vince for this one. Appearance - Deep amber orange, completely translucent, not sediment or haze at all. Pours with a very frothy slightly off white 2 finger head that dissipates to about 1 finger and leaves a nice lacing all the way around the glass. Smell - The smell has some great pine and citrus qualities from the hops. A very rustic and earthy scent can be found. There are hints of grapefruit and a bit of orange rind. Great presence of the biscuity malt and some caramel sweetness. Taste - Not a lot of that pine and rustic earth come through on the taste but you do get some good bitterness in the form of citrus and the biscuity sweet malt comes out nicely on the end with a surge of fruity grapefruit and orange. All of that is followed by a nice bitter finish. I love the fruity sweetness followed by that bitterness. Mouthfeel - This seems a bit watery for my liking, and a bit light too, it doesn't take away from the beer too much though luckily, still great. The carbonation seems pretty good, maybe a bit overcarbonated. Drinkability - This one has good drinkability, nothing amazing, I could definitely drink a few cans.

Pours lightly hazy orange amber with a good two finger foamy white head that leaves some foamy rings of lacing and holds a light foamy cap.

Good strength. Flavor is able to retain some of the citrus fruitiness of the nose, but not all, more resinous hops on the tongue, pine, floral, and a fair bit of sweet bready malt, kinda surprised by the level of sweetness here for an IPA but does help keep it balanced. Fair bitterness on the finish but the sweetness sticks around as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily and sticky, medium carbonation. Very glad to finally try this and it is an excellent well-balanced IPA. The nose is by far my favorite aspect...very nice.

Citrus is worked in too, with notes of grapefruit pith, lemon zest & maybe a spot of orange or tangerine. Not a whole lot of predominant malts, just a little sugar cookie sweetness. The hop profile is very clean. Quite tasty without exhibiting lots of bitterness. The nose seems to be a good indicator, as there's a tendency toward floral & mild pine notes upfront; moderately dense citrus notes are more notable in the middle. Tangerine, lemon & grapefruit fill it out nicely. Faintest of toasty malt in the back; honestly, it's negligible. Maybe a hint of caramel. Medium-light body gets a little heavier as it warms.

Head is huge, towering at at least 3 fingers of dense off-white goodness, and taking a good while to settle back down. Tons and tons of delicate lacing covering the walls of the glass as the head recedes. Nose comes through as direct but very well done - big grapefruity citrus hops sit on top of a light bed of toasty caramel, really well put together and refined. Taste is very, very good. World class even. Grapefruity hops come through big to start, though this one is all flavor and almost no bitterness - hopbursted? - with a firm layer underneath of toasty caramel malt that is just in absolute perfect balance for an IPA. The hops are clearly the star of the show, but the malt is just dialed in to perfection. Wow. Finish starts with a big juicy-sweet grapefruit burst, and carries a very manageable bitterness that never builds out of control as the finish dries right up. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium-full bodied, maybe just a tiny bit sticky. Really exceptionally done. Drinkability is startlingly good, up there with my best IPA experiences.

A thick mat of nearly-white head collapses to a still-impressive thin, but dense cap on top of a clear copper body. Bright, citric hops like fresh lime zest and juicy orange with just a touch of pine. Plenty of malt character too with a solid dose of warm, toasted Munich malt. Caramel is there too but it just smooths out the edges of the beer and softens the blow of the supposed 90+ IBUs. Speaking of which, this IPA drinks more like a 60 IBU beer thanks to the malt support, which can be good or bad depending on your hoppy beer imbibing preferences. I, personally, like my IPAs both ways. More balanced seems to work well for a beer only pushing 6% ABV. A great beer in a can. Not such a rarity these days, but still nice to see. The only detractor is the $11/sixer price, which makes it hard for this to compete with some of the bigger hop-happy brewers like Sierra Nevada.",1279656760

A really great canned IPA for the pool /beach or really anywhere. I also like Avery IPA, and Modus in cans, but I would have to give this brew a leg up on either, a little more fruit and hops than the others and at 6.1 ABV really drinkable. Not terribly bitter either, so it would makea great IPA for anyone who wants to step up ftom PA's to IPA's. Also found the last sixer in Myrtle Beach on the shelf, and what a great surprise. Not only the only the only canned IPA available but a damn tasty one, Drank it out of the can so I have no idea on what it looked like, smelled like or any kinda head retention, but I loved it. I also had some Modus, but Caldera was definitely a little more fruity. IMO a real find, and a real solid A kinda brew. Would have scored higher if not being guzzled at the beach which knocked down the appearance and nose, Drink ability is good but the ABV in the killer heat had to be respected although not a heavyweight in this dept",1279487880

Beautiful, brilliantly clear coppery orange beer with a thick cap of ivory bubbles that lasts throughout the whole drink. Wonderful sticky lacing. Nose is full of strong citrus hops, with grapefruit and orange the leading flavors. Note, as the beer warms, a mild diacetyl butteriness becomes noticeable. Very hopforward, with a nice malt backbone. Citrus hops pack a punch throughout, with some big bitterness and some resiny characteristics on the finish. Medium mouthfeel, with a resiny finish that mildly detracts from the brew. Overall a very drinkable hop bomb, a true big northwest IPA.",1279169746

Good taste, not tongue numbing hops or bitterness, just the right amount for an active outdoor lifestyle for this ipa. Right amount of sweetness. Not heavy on the palate at all. Good summer ipa. Nothing outlandish mouthfeel wise. $10 a 6 was difficult at first, but seems to be a decent price after all.",1278974127
6.1,10784,1075,Caldera IPA,American IPA,4,3.5,4,4,jzeilinger,4,"A - Seems a little funny to review a canned beer by appearance since we can't see it and it goes directly from the can and right down the hatch! Pours an amber orange color with a creamy one fingered head. The foam dies down gradually but keeps an even layer on top. Moderate amount of carbonation. S - All I'm getting is delicate citrus, bisquit, and caramel. Not overly aromatic for an IPA and I'm having an unusually hard time picking up any other nuances. T - Light caramel biscuity malt, with a little bit of sugary sweetness at the front of the tongue. The tongue is greeted with caramel malt and almost immediately after is hit with the citrus hopping to keep the sweetness in perfect check. There's a caramel-like grapefruit bitterness left in the mouth and eventually, nothing but grapefruit bitterness after the sweetness dies down. M - Slightly on the heavier side of medium bodied, smooth feel as it rolls over the tongue with the carbonation being more on the creamy side than prickly. D - Very, very good. Very finely balanced. I din't like it at first so I waited to have a second can on a different day to give it a fair chance. I have to say it's growing on me. At 6.1%, I could drink these all day, a nice change up from the high octane beers.",1278972867

Poured the beer into a 'Hoegaarden' Grand Cru glass. looked good, huge cream coloured head sat on top of a dull, hazy, dark amber/orange body. The head produced some heavy lacing and tried to stay throughout the tasting. The nose was of yeasts and hops along with some grain type esters. The hops from the aroma take over the taste completely, a real bitterness hits the mouth and throat. Why do they (or is it you?) have to over hop everything in the US when they brew an IPA? There really is no need to do so. It isn't as bad (hop wise) as some I've reviewed, but still too hoppy for my tender tastebuds. It is true to the American IPA style and I think one of the better examples I've had (I am not a huge fan of the style though).",1278684178

6.1,10784,1075,Caldera IPA,American IPA,4,4,4,4,BeerAdvocate,4,"Beer review from BA Mag Oct 2007. Hooray! for canned craft beer. We really love this format and how quickly it is spreading throughout the US. Options are great, especially when you are in no glass zones such as poolside, on a boat, on the beach--and also simply for the fact that the can is a great space saver. Stodgy off-white head, the sticky mass shows its great retention as it stays strong all the way down to the bottom of the glass. Clear copper-penny hue; a few bubbles race to the top. Citric, pine and black tea hop aroma. Hint of melon, estery alcohol and sweet toasted malt in the background. Lots of smoothness to go around--extremely smooth. Slightly chewy medium body shows the malt is not just going to sit back while getting pummeled by the hops. Mild cookie-like sweetness from the malt has a faint toasted graininess to it. Hops come in with a controlled but precise bitterness, strong but still leaving some balance. Big minty hop flavor very slowly dissipates with citric rind, evergreen, black tea leaves and a sweet Mandarin orange flavor. Finishes a little bittersweet with a rock-solid hop flavor and sweet biscuity maltiness. This is a great example if you are looking to try a Pacific Northwest (PNW) India Pale Ale. Hops all around, both in bitterness and flavor, with enough malt to keep everything in balance. Nothing over the top. It's simply a great IPA--and it's in a can.",1278462382

I pick up grapefruit, flowers, a touch of herbs and grass and a bit of musk smell that I associate with Columbus hops, a nice fresh hop aroma. The malt has a very noticeable toasted/biscuit note, much more up front than many IPAs. Taste is quite smooth overall, the biscuity malt balances nicely with the hop bitterness. It starts with light malt, a tad toasted with a noticeable hop bitterness, this transitions into a brighter, more hop focused flavor. The finish is remnants of biscuity malts and some hop bitterness and citrus. Overall, even a minute after I take a sip, the toasty malt is the dominant flavor on the finish. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium to thick with moderate carbonation. Overall I very much enjoyed this beer, a big IPA with a strong malt base yet substantial hop flavor.

Head retention is low, but lacing is very nice. S: Somewhat dulled at first, but as the beer warms a bit the hops and malt shine through at the same time.

Malt character is mild, but there are hints of caramel, toast, and dried fruit in the backround. It's a very balanced beer. M & D: Medium bodied and full of flavor.

The eggshell head is real fluffy and big. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick sheet of foam on top throughout the duration of the drink. S: Very pungent nose; tropical fruits like pineapple and slight mango, piny resinous hops, and slight earthy undertones. Citrus (grapefruit and slight orange and lemon peel) is also apparent. Alcohol peeks through the nose a little bit, but doesn't take away from anything. Malts give a firm base and seem like they will balance nicely. T: A little different from the nose...the 94 IBUs really shine and give off a puckering bitterness. Earthy, resinous, and citric hops make up a majority of the flavor. I don't know exactly what gives this flavor off (I have the same thing in my dry hopped IPA that was brewed a few weeks ago) but it tastes like the smell of whole hop flowers- slightly vegetal...I did dry hop with Simcoe so maybe thats where it comes from. Malts lend a caramel and toffee backing that helps to balance, but seems to be consumed by the hop bombardment. MF/D: Smooth and creamy feel. Pretty big body for the style. Carbonation is awesome- at the ideal level in my book. Not necessarily a complete palate killer, but close to it. This makes for a good outdoor occasion IPA. Notes: Solid IPA. Typical of the west coast style- bitter and resinous. Great tailgate or beach beer",1275512166

New to my blighted and ""Famously Hot"" city of Columbia - the heart of Darkness of South Carolina - Caldera IPA is a welcome reminder that I once lived, nay, was even born in the Pacific Northwest.... and someday may be blessed to return. The Caldera can itself is a rather ugly yellow with lots of hop cones around a, uh, caldera (cauldron) and the whole thing is rather an affront to the eyes, perhaps designed by a 2nd year art student who dropped out to smoke dope and lie on the beach with his rotund black lab and pierced girlfriend, but what do I know. Caldera IPA is a dull, clear deep yellow, with a nice head that never really dies and some nice sticky lace. Smells good, but not great - pungent and resiny West-Coast-Yo hops, malt is regulated to the background. Grapefruit and some citrusy fruit, a smack of booze. Taste is similar, more hop-bitter forward, a bit thin, sweet but not terribly characterful malt. No real surprises here, but it's not bad. A fine finish, adequate carbonation and some finishing hop bitterness turn this into a pretty solid IPA. Caldera can't quite hang with the big dogs, and at a price of $12 a six pack has to do a little more to justify itself in my mind. This is a good IPA, but the world is rife with good IPAs...

Many of the previous reviews state a syrupy consistency, and I agree it is syrupy, however, if your a DIPA lover, you won't mind it a bit. Chugs more like a DIPA which I love. You'll get whacked up front with a nice citrus profile before a light sweet malt and lingering bitterness take over. The bitterness is just right leading you to raise your glass in another slug creating a nice drinkabillity which many IPAs do not nail.

A little hazy in color but does have a nice lively action look to it. Nose was toned down a bit for me. More of malty caramel sweetness hits the nostrils followed with a subtle touch of grapefruit and grass. Taste was extremely sweet at first of a heavy walloping malty gooey-ness of a backbone. Nice bitterness, grassy and zesty taste. Finishes with a hop grind makes me think of pure hop oil. Mouth is medium bodied,good carbonation, a little bit on the thick syrupy side. Nice kiss of stickiness on the lips from the hop residue. A solid IPA. A bit heavy for my liking when I think of IPA but for the malt IPA lovers this is your baby.",1325383668

A Orangey-rust with a fantastic fluffy cream colored head. Great head retention which hangs around for a good 10 minutes. There are two fairly prominent floaties in here; not sure if they're hops, or pieces of Oregon. S The aroma is a little subdued, but what I'm getting out of it, I like. Lots of really earthy pinecones and trees, orange marmalade, light grass and a fair amount of caramel dipped bread. T I don't see a date on the can, but I think this might be on the older side. BUT, being just over the hill doesn't stop this from being delicious. The hop profile is on the mild side, but maintains for the entire taste with fresh cut grass, lemon soda, barely bitter grapefruit and spruce. The malt that backs all of that up comes out in toasted nuts, lightly sweet caramel, hearty rye bread. There is a really nice balance going on here while I would like the hops to stand up a little more, the malt profile is still second fiddle. But even though the malt characteristics take a backseat to the hops, the nut+caramel bread combo is fantastic. M No problems here medium bodied, a touch on the syrupy side with an understated carbonation pop. O Easily a beer I could drink by the six pack. Also would be good for a newer ipa drinker who need some malt balance and isn't bitter to the point of no return.",1324936267

Pours a pretty amber, with a good 1/4"" of off-white head - and while it dies down, I can already tell that it's going to leave a good lace. The nose seems somewhat muted, but I can pick up grapefruit, and a bit of pine. Somewhat bracing in its bitterness - significant grapefruit that really lasts. A very crisp pine flavor comes through as well. Quite hoppy, but no associated burn. A little viscous on the tongue, tucking into each crevasse in the mouth. Good carbonation - really leads the tongue to enjoy the hoppiness.

Plenty of frothy sticky icky lace - whitish, messy and organic like foam off the ocean. A lingering head that leaves plenty of webbed lacing down the glass. Smells like an artists interpretation of hydroponic marijuana. Incredibly dank, backed by a tight jolt of crystalline sugar. Smells of wild fields of flora and fauna. In my head I am brought to my knees, imbibing in nature's melody. In for one more whiff... DANK! High in the nostril a hint of potently sweet floral hopiness surfaces and then disappears. Wow. That nose is expressed well in the mouth. Starts wet and slightly sweet, attaining a Noble hop bite on the front of the tongue. Low sweet caramel notes hold things briefly in check but the hopiness only continues to grow from the front to back. In the middle a plethora of fruity notes emerge - grapefruit, lemons and oranges. In the next flash though its the earthier, piney hop that begins to shine. By it's finish the show is brutally bitter - it 'Arcs' only as it finishes. A puckering bitterness that again brings to mind the wild tastes of a forest. Hops are pooling on all sides of my mouth with pine-like bitterness. My tongue is buckling, and I'm wondering if I'm as much of a hop head as I think I am. The hops are imposing their will on my senses, and I'm starting to beg for mercy. The brewer has fortunately carbonated the hell out of this beer. The hydrophobic (read: oily) resins are minimized by all the surface area provided by these bubbles.

T: Opens very crisp, refreshing. Piney hop character presents itself towards the middle as the beer warms a bit. Citrus and cane sugar sweetness is present at the back but is overtaken quickly by an astringent, hoppy bite. Finish is a leafy bitterness, as if I've chewed a hop nugget. Aggressive!

Appearance: Pours a pretty vibrant copper color and starts with about a 1 finger of slightly off-white head that fades to a pretty full and thick skim; body is clear and shows strong carbonation; a prety full curtain of lacing holds tight to the sides of the glass. Smell: A lot of nice and bitter hops like a good IPA should have - tons of pine and bitter citric fruit peel. Straightforward, no questions to be asked. Taste: I'm impressed - Caldera's Pale Ale was a real let down, but this is quite solid; lots of bitter hops right up front -- very piney and that citric fruit peel that is oh so nice and bitter and not juicy at all (not that juicy is bad either, but this one is straight up bitter); faint malt presence offers a little bit of sweetened balance, but the bitter dominates; fairly strong metallic aftertaste, but it's still really good and doesn't downplay the solid flavors too much. Mouthfeel: Strong carbonation makes it feel very crisp and lively; body isn't thin, but not quite thick either -- about where I would like an IPA; a nice stickiness from all that hop resin coats the roof of the mouth quite nicely. Drinkability: Actually, I could probably drink this all day; nice solid bitter flavor with a crisp and refreshing body; would be great for a hot summer day, but I can't complain about drinking it when it's 15 degrees outside either...",1262920359

ECE/SAE amber colored liquid with three fingers of solid soapy seashell foam which recedes to a thin but persistent layer leaving agressive lacing behind resembling a mackerel sky with tiny clouds embedded in faint legs. Brilliant clarity. While there is strong citrus in the nose (with tell-tale orange zest), the Simcoe hops seem the most pronounced of the three utilized, with their distinctive forest-floor/pine contribution. There is also an herbal borderline ""catty"" note that I didn't notice the last time I tried this beer (though since it is canned I don't think it was light-struck!). Mint, orange pith, and pine needles on the palate with an undercurrent of pale malt. Unripe citrus bitterness with a bit of lemon/lime but no grapefruit. Finishes rather dry and faintly toasty. A little less pronounced malt that many NW IPAs - though more than most IPAs from SoCal. Zippy, resinous, and highly carbonated - this is quite refreshing. An excellent choice for car camping or a fishing trip.",1262403473
6.1,10784,1075,Caldera IPA,American IPA,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,jwc215,4,"Pours copper with a rich off-white head. Trailing lace nearly covers the glass. The smell is of pine, herbal spicing, some medicinal notes, perfumy, with orange and grapefruit. A nice, complex hop aroma! The taste is of an herbal, aspirin-ish, bitterness with grapefruit and orange. Alcohol comes through in a peppery way. Slight metallic (steely) notes accompany the caramel backing. Medium-bodied. This is a nicely done, hoppy IPA, even for the style, with a solid caramel backing. Despite slight metallic/steely notes and slight show of the abv, this one disappears ""too"" quickly and is certainly worth seeking out if you're a follower of the hops! A nice IPA in a can - I'm a happy man!",1262314296

Definitely what I expect from a west coast IPA. Some caramel, too. Good hop flavor. Very pithy. Light sweetness up front, then citrus peel bitterness.

A good hop bite and a decent malt backbone that provides a bit of caramel sweetness that blends nicely. A bit of spice, grassiness, and some lemon zest round out the floral and citrus hops. M- Good carbonation, hops are hoppy (duh) and stick with you for a while. Leaves quite the lasting impression. D- Sessionable. Tasty. A winner in my book.

Review from notes. A- Pours semi-hazy orange/reddish color. One and a half light tan/offwhite head that stays for a little while. Nice soapy lacing hat slides down the glass. S- Tropical fruit (pineapple) upfront along with other citrusy hops. Light bready malts in the background. Very light earthy floral hops...these could have been a little more in the aroma in my opinion. T- Nice bitter hop bite right off the bat which I didn't foresee. Light malt sweetness in the middle and toward the end. Bitter hop again in the end but not quite as big as in the front. Also a light medical alcohol taste which was a little distracting. M- Lighter mouthfeel. Good carbonation for the style. Hops left a trainwreck of bitterness on the palate. Some hop resin stuck around after each sip. Light tropical fruit in the aftertaste. D- Very drinkable IPA in my book. The light alcohol taste kind of brought the taste down a half point in my review but after some sips it went away. Nothing is over the top about this IPA and I would easily make this my session beer if it was near me.,1261356086

Definitely not the familiar yellowish, golden orange of most IPAs. Large off-white head. Smells faintly of pine, more strongly of ... well, citrus. Not quite grapefruit, just citrus-y. And there's maybe a whiff of malt. Well, maybe not. There's a strange toasted after-taste to the malt, and the hop flavoring is a touch muted. Really more like a pale ale than an ipa to me, though not quite that either. Some grapefruit, some random-y citrus notes, and a touch of sweet malt. Decent, but nothing to write home about.",1260945337

Different aromas, but on par with Pliny and Sculpin. T: The Simcoe train doesn't stop at the nose. Plenty of bitterness and a nice grapefruit flavor as well. Not quite as good as the nose, but almost. M: This is the one area I think the beer falls a bit short. The body is on the thin/watery side, but the carbonation levels are fine.

S- Herbal, lemon grass, piney and a tad of citrus. Has a lot of herbs from far away, even, and it has a very nice balance of all 5 scents. T- slightly spicy, malty, but held on because of the hops. This had a little less to it than i thought it would, but its probably because im used to DIPA's. To be fair, it has a remarkable balance to it...i really enjoy this beer, and for something in a ""can"", which most people are shaky about, i found it impressive.

Pours a nice, slightly hazy, toasted ruby-brown color. There's visible carbonation running throughout, feeding a short, well-retained white head. There's a tremendous amount of sticky white lace that marbles the sides of the glass without any signs of fading. Smell is all hops - aromas of grapefruit rind and earthy, musky hops come through. There's only the slightest indication of sweetness from the malts. Taste definitely reflects the largely hop-forwardness of the aroma. The bitter citrus rind presence in most detectable in the aftertaste, and a hint of the piney, oily sticky hops hits the tongue early on. There is more of a malt foundation in the taste, but it is hardly sweet - more toasty, full and warm. The aftertaste is really nice; it makes me want to wait between sips to enjoy it a little more. Feel is bright and perfectly carbonated - not too much and not too little. It fills the mouth and spreads the flavors around the palate very well. This is one highly drinkable beer. I was tempted to drink it from the can because you don't see that all that often with crafts. I went for the glass, and enjoyed every last drop. Definitely recommended for a try.

Whoops! I already drank one of my three this morning before even writing anything down. My notes for Ashland Amber included commentary on the CAN itself, including verbiage and mention of CAN-conditioning. This, however, was a visually appealing CAN with vibrant color reproduction and a green pop-tab. My buds at that stoner joint, Roots (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10996/?view=beerfly), would fully dig this CAN. Hey, before anybody gets their panties in a bunch, a) I kid and b) I CAN pass a urinalysis standing on my head. I dig beer, you dig? Plus, that place has a really smoky vibe and I am sure that they would not be particularly offended. Onward. Both times, my pour has begun with a finger of ecru head which has simply sat down, leaving sticky Belgian lacing in its wake. The nose is forest hops - pine, green, earthy, sticky, massive. Sweet hops the hope of my life - once again, that damned howling monkey shut up and climbed off of my back for the moment. I am on the waiting list for hops rehab but it's a long list and I may not last that long. Thank Bob for hops! It now becomes a simple matter of drawing some of this delectable beverage into a syringe through a needle and jamming said needle into one of the few remaining viable veins. No heating necessary. Cold fusion is more satisfactory, anyway. Once I untie my rubber hose, the euphoric quality begins to set in. I am one with the Beeriverse. My existance is justified. I'm not just a simple Hophead. I am a HopJunkie and an unapologetic one, at that. My licking the lacing out of the glass is starting to draw stares from the nieghbors. So what?!? The heck with them!

Citrus and pine hops jump out of the glass with orange, lime, dried apricot, subtle peach (I know...it's weird, but that's what I got), pine, and easy hop leaves followed by a clear caramel, biscuit, and a touch of cereal grains. On the palate, there is a medium hop bitterness that shows fron the beginning through the finish that is smooth, but a little lean and kind of weak for an IPA. Although the beer is very smooth, balanced, and easy to drink, I was looking for more of a hop presence from this beer (being that's it's a west coast style IPA).

A combination of pale and caramel malt flavors up front are soon overtaken by bright citrus hop and earthy leafy hop flavors. Near the end of the sip the malt flavors take over and have a grainy quality before giving way to a solidly bitter and crisp ending. Mouthfeel is good.

Smell - The hops are deep, rich, and complex here and quickly surpass the good malty base of this ale. There's a beautiful orange citrus here that isn't too sweet but more like the aroma of a fine orange liqueur. The stiff pine gives a contrasting compliment to the citrus and a bit of lemongrass to complete the puzzle. Taste - The big malt base, almost like a DIPA, comes on much stronger at the taste and is amazingly able to hold its own against these huge, complex hops. The pine from the nose steps back a bit on the tongue but otherwise this ale tastes like it smells. Mouthfeel - This is a solid medium-bodied with some large bitterness that is tempered by the light toffee sweetness of the malts. The carbonation is rightly light and overall this IPA has a terrific mouthfeel.

A - I was happy to see a real nice amber color to this beer as I poured it from the can into the glass I had just retrieved from the freezer. The only other canned beer I have tried recently that I can recommend is Dales Pale Ale. Many people cannot believe that a decent beer can come from a can. For the most part, I agree. This, as with Dales, is an exception. Knowing a decent canned beer is valued quintessentially to those of us who enjoy the back-country experience and like to pack out what we pack in. There is something special about being able to stick a couple of really good ales or IPA's in the snow on a telemarking trek and enjoy that beverage in the raw and untamed wild. I have had a few such occasions in the beautiful Arapahoe Nat. Forest of Summit County, CO. This ale poures into a chilled glass easily with a two to three finger, full, creamy head and leaves a sweet lacing on the glass, all the way to the last sip. The well carbonated ale continues to offer a flow of small bubbles consistently as it stands in the glass. As for the appearance, I have to say that I also am quite fond of the labeling. Anyone collecting cans should have a Caldera IPA in the line-up. S - The smell of this beer is what you want folks who think beer stinks to sample. I could imagine Caldera IPA incense, the smell is so natural and becoming. I used to appreciate deeply the aroma of the pines and aspens as I guided horseback tours in the Colorado Divide, and this is what Caldera reminds me of. T - Caldera IPA tastes delicious. I love hoppy beers and this satisfies while I would say it won't scare off those who like a hoppy beer but are somewhat easily offended. It has a nice bitterness that says a solid hello from the tip of the tongue around both sides, but doesn't try to rip apart your mucous membranes with the vigor and skill of pissed off Norseman. The flavor is complex, sensuous and mystifying. The finish is crisp and clean and as I am experiencing at this very moment, one simply is not enough. My glass is in the freezer right now getting prepped for a second round. M - This IPA has a full bodied, smooth and delightful feel that is welcome on the palate, to be savored and swallowed slowly, eyes closed and head tilted slightly aft, slowly exhaling through the nose to extract the many intricacies that the craftsmen at Caldera have steeped into this marvelous 12 ounce can. D - At 6.1%, this IPA is very, very drinkable. Beware, if you are not on foot and close to home while enjoying Caldera IPA - it can sneak up on you. Filling? Not terribly for such a well built and hardy concoction. THE FINAL ANALYSIS: If you enjoy drinking beer, you must try Caldera IPA - especially if you like to drink out of bounds.",1253477448

I drank this brew straight from the can which probably didn't assist the experience but it us definitely a drinkable ipa. As previously stated it is quite hoppy for a can which is refreshing. I am not able to get this at home so I am glad that I tried it.,1252729215
6.1,10784,1075,Caldera IPA,American IPA,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,mbunje,4,"Served from a Trippy Graphic Yellow Can into a Sam Adams glass. No brewed on date. Purple ring around the top points out all the advantages cans have over glass for outdoor activity. A - Medium copper, clear, not much carbonation present, head was small and disappears rather quickly. S - Pale bready malt, citric hops. Not overpowering, but definitely there. T - Citric hops beat out the malt from the get go. If you are a hop head, you will like this for just a ""regular"" IPA. Bitter in a good way. MF - Light to medium bodied. Crisp. Dry. Very nice. D - $8.99 per six'r = $1.50 per 12oz. Cans a 0.5 adder too. So very drinkable given the price, medium body, and can. Overall - This is a great IPA can or not. Can doesn't give any residual metalic taste that I can pick up (when drinking from a glass). I will take this over a pour into a red plastic cup at the beach (I will test that theory tomorrow!) Good one. Got to try others from Caldera.",1252632725

Pours clear and deep golden/copper in color and offers a nice bubbly half inch of off white head. This settles to a surface cap in a minute or two but doesn't hold up to offer any lacing with the carbonation heading for the hills by half glass. Nice blend of hops on the nose with some orange citrus and fresh cut pine, with a certain resiny quality in that regard. Hops are quite light and become a bit more elusive over time. Some clean fruity malt notes accompany. Good quality but not quantity. Smooth in flavor and light in body as predicted from the nose. Finishes with a distinct and lingering orange flavor and just a hint of bitterness follows. Decent unobtrusive feel and drink. This is an IPA 'Lite' for me. Light hops and malts, well balanced yes, but very light bodied for the style. Would have dubbed this an APA. Wonder what their Pale is like?",1251411241

Plenty of bubbles rising to the top. Good retention and good lacing. Aroma is of floral and earthy hops, candied oranges, and fruit juice. Tastes of grassy and piney hops with a touch of orange rind. Malt sweetness adds some balance, but not a lot. West Coast in terms of bitterness, but not a lot of aromatic or fruity hops. Finish has lots of bitter floralness. Medium bodied and sticky with full carbonation. Very similar to the pale ale, but with more hopping and more malts. I thought initially this was better, but then realized I would rather have less of this flavor since I don't particularly enjoy it. Not enough malt to be ""balanced"" but not floral or fruity enough to be a tasty San Diego style either. So-so.",1250934691

Old habits die hard.... Pours a golden copper color with half an inch of off-white head. Nice lacing clings to the glass. The aroma, even after it warms, doesn't give me anything but grapefruit and tangerine hops. The scent, while very nice for an IPA, just seems muted. I guess I just want it more in my face and not so much like a sachet of hops thrown in a drawer. Make sense? The flavor is more in my face...and I like it! I wish I could give this one a 4.25 cuz that is where I feel it belongs. Nice and bitter hops come out in a wide range of citrus flavors. It's pretty damn bitter, but that is why I like it. A bit earthy at the end. Also had a taste of powdered aspirin right at the finish. The finish keeps it from getting to that 4.5 for me. Medium bodied. Average carbonation. Bitter, drying aftertaste screams for you to take another sip and I'll gladly oblige. Another canned beer worthy of any tailgating, camping, golfing, outdoor event of your choosing where bottles are frowned upon.

No bottling info is given. A-Pours a fairly clear amber with orange and peach highlights. Has a 3/4 finger off white head that fades fast into a small filmy patch. S-It is a tad weak in the nose. It almost seems like it was not dry hopped. It reminds me more of bittering hops. There is some grapefruit and pine as well as some biscuit malt and some caramel malt. T-The first part of each sip is pretty good. There is a bracing level of grapefruit bitterness that hits fast. It is definitely earthy/herbal tasting with a tad bit of malt sweetness in the middle. It finishes with some medicinal flavor and leaves an aspirin aftertaste. It also feels a little roasty. M-It is thinner bodied and the carbonation is fine. It has a roasty and dry aftertaste. D-The medicinal/aspirin taste is not my thing. It is hard to tell if this is how it is supposed to taste based on the fact that there is no bottling info on the can.

S: Pine, citrus, and grapefruit all the way, almost to the point of smelling like a Fresca! (how's that for an obscure reference). The malt is also noticeable in the form of a little fruitness. T: Wow! The hops pack a whallop both in the nose and in the finish of the taste, but the sweet malt coats the tongue and the throat and balances out nicely. The aftertaste of so many hops does take down the mouthfeel a bit, but the taste is definitely...tasty!!! M: The hops sting a bit, even in the mouthfeel, but the malt is moderately thick, which helps wash everything down. The only drawback I can see is that the hops stick around so much in the aftertaste. It wants me to drink more, but it still is a little surprising. D: This is a good IPA. Almost like a Firestone Pale Ale supercharged; the hops are front and center, and the malt does its job to try and balance it, but the overall impression is HOPS.

So it pours into the glass a lovely toasty bronze-rust color, with a crazy-fluffy head that looks like the top of a root-beer float. Lasts a long while too. Nose is ultra-hoppy...very much veering into the fresh fabric-softener breeziness area. Not much else behind it, but gotta love it. Flavor is delightful hoppiness all the way. Bright, breezy, a bit intense but not overwhelming. The malts carefully and successfully offer backup, or maybe more of a foundation than anything, as the prickly, colorful hops continue to be the magical ingredient with each sip. A little green, a little leafy, and very, very nice unless you're not into hops. A slight twist of graininess that reminds of rye carries through, especially into the finish. Also some candy-like sweetness, especially with a little warming. Mouthfeel is neither here nor there. Not much to say about it, but it's fine. It's a medium-bodied beer with some prickly carbonation and a bit of stickiness. A very solid IPA, and a very drinkable west-coast version of the style. It's not over-the-top while still exuding the character of its region, and the ABV makes it completely manageable if you're wanting several in a row.",1249940104

A- Poured into an imperial pint glass, this beer pours a clear light-copper color with a sticky head of foam that reduces to a thin layer over the beer. Each sip leaves some web-like lacing along the inside of the glass. S- Piney, oily hop aromas with a malt backing that has a slight element of fruity sweetness but mostly smells of rich crakerish grain. There's a corse, almost metallic note to the smell, much like most of Sierra Nevada's beers. In fact, Caldera's IPA smells very much like a Sierra Nevada beer. Celebration Ale comes to mind. T- Lots of bitter grapefruit flavor. Grainy, bready malts provide minimal balance. Pithy flavors of melon rind lead the way to a dry finish that leaves a hoppy and slightly metallic bitterness lingering on the palate. M- The mouthfeel is very full-bodied with some nice fizzy carbonation that complements the thick and somewhat oily texture. D- The 6.1% ABV makes it easy to have a few of these in a row, but I would have liked a little more fruity sweetness in the flavor to balance out the big bitterness. A very tasty IPA.

S-Piney hops with some citrus aroma present. Very inviting. T-Somewhat disappointing since the flavor does not match well with expected smell and is dominated by earthy bitterness that is ultimately unbalanced. I couldn't discern any malt backbone. Very bitter, persistent after taste. Not very pleasant. Unsure about freshness, but this has not been a concern from the seller/distributors. I like hoppy IPAs, but prefer balance too. Balance was absent. M-Begins well but ends up being harsh because of the after taste. Low to medium carbonation gives is it a smoothness that is unfortunately emasculated by the bitterness. D-An average West Coast IPA. Okay, but I won't buy again. The bitter aftertaste nearly gave me heartburn. If offered one to drink I would drink it but only after concluding nothing better is available. A bit pricey compared to better Oregon brewed IPAs.

S: Complex and sumptuous aromas of pine, citrus, sweet caramel and pale malt, tropical fruit, and leaf all come through to present a most appetizing brew. T: the flavor does not deliver fully on the promising smell and it is dominated by earthy, leafy bitterness that leaves all complexity behind. The malt flavors peek through to a minor extent with some balancing sweetness. This is a great beer for hopsheads who like pure raw bitterness hitting them in the mouth. M: Pretty slick and coating with low-medium carbonation and a spicy-bitter aftertaste. D: A not bad, not great IPA that won't win any awards for value.

Even it's color, in a different sense, could be described as caramel. It was a pretty good beer, but I prefer my IPAs to be a little more hop dominant, and a little less malty. I enjoyed it, but I didn't think it was anything to write home about. Color was a dark rich amber color, with a good amount of head. Aroma was malt first, with lots of caramel notes and some hoppiness. Flavor was exceedingly balanced, more like an amber ale than an IPA, with the hops just barely peeking out from behind more caramel flavor. Mouthfeel was light, crisp, and pleasant.

A big head of white coming up and over the top and settling down with a good amount of side glass lacing. Big aroma of fresh hops on this one. Just a huge nose of grapefruit, pineapple and hints of orange peel. Deep and resionous, almost sticky just in the aroma. As the first sip hits, not as sharp and pungent as the aroma, but seriously this was a good IPA. Nice and tight with the fresh hops letting your lips stick to your teeth. Lots of pineapple and grapefruit leading the way but fading into a nice mid palate of buttery malts. Nice medium feel and an easy, very smooth sessionability. Overall this was excellent.

Even with a careful pour the head rose up with a mighty fury. Retention is strong and the lacing coats around the glass. This is a great looking beer. S: Crisp with pine and lemon citrus hops. This is pure bitter hops with no real malt aromas to be found. Grapefruit and peppered orange slush. Spiced apples and limes. Hints of fresh herb and cannabis. T: This is a juicy lemon crisp beer with black pepper finish. Solid hops taste that is strong but not overwhelming. Much like the nose this is crisp and refreshing tasting. Slight buttery malt backdrop but overall this is all about the hops. Leaves a strong bitter aftertaste that goes perfect with some spiced foods. M: Juicy with perfect carbonation. Sticks all around the mouth. D: Since I have been in a can craft beer zone recently this psychedelic yellow six pack caught my attention. These drink quickly and easily. A little pricey at $10.99 a six but it ended up being a pretty good investment. Very impressive IPA. New Valis album goes well with a number of these.,1244858084

Bronze/copper color with a rocky pale cream head. Sticky lacing remains on the glass and is slowly revealed as the head sinks into the beer. S- Citrus forward. Lemons and limes, fruit Smarties, and grapefruit. Aroma is a little lighter than I remember, and not much malt behind the hops in nose. T/M- A slight chalkiness upfront on the flavor before the citrus comes through. Grapefruit and grapes pop prominently. Bitterness is all on the finish, with a nice moderate IBU level that could be about 10-15 higher per my preference. Alcohol announces it's presence, but not over powering. Body is medium, leaning towards heavy. Carbonation is fairly low, leaving this slick and borderline slimy in the mouth. O- I like this beer now, but I love it when I get it at the bar and don't analyze it as much. Has solid properties, but nothing that makes it stand out against other competitors.

T - Funny how your brain needs to adjust when drinking out of a can; first sip of this was during a round of golf, right out of the can and my first thought was, ""wow, this is GOOD beer"" because you're expecting something thin and watered down. A ""proper"" tasting confirms my first sip; poured into a glass, this is a damn good, drinkable IPA. Nice hint of sweetness up front which is quickly run over by a nice rindy, bittery-y flavor which hangs around on the tongue for quite a while between sips.

The hops are clear, but frankly are less enticing that it seems they ought to be. Nothing about how this beer smells turns me away, but there's not much to really draw me in. Caldera IPA is surprisingly mild on first sip, with the pine and citrus hop balance eventually coming through. Relatively subtle but clear bitterness complements the beer without overtaking it. Pleasant lingering mild bitterness in the finish, with an overall sense of earthiness. Light to medium bodied, leaning toward light. Slight drying effect makes me want another sip. A solid, drinkable beer, and the light body actually boosts the drinkability rating. Still, for $14.99 a six-pack I'll gladly stick with something else.

A rather tame aroma consisting of grass, floral-pine, sourdough, with a touch of funk. Images of that candy I got every Halloween, bottlecaps, creep into my head. Piney, earthy hops attack the palate; more flower than citrus in this NW IPA. Just enough caramel and bready malt to provide a little balance with touches of butterscotch. The finish is a grassy, bitter greens that drys the mouth to Sahara like levels. A touch of alcohol too. The can tells the story with a handful of hops boiling a black pot, did I mention the can?

Including Caldera IPA. Not only never heard of the brew, no clue the brewery even existed. The pour is the initial use of a Flying Fish glass that marcpal sent me recently. Clearly he read my mind about the need for smaller glasses in the house. Thanks Marc! The 12 oz. goes into the tulip with about an ounce or so to spare. The smell knocks me for a loop, a bitter, disgusted, angry, fucked-up hophead's dream searing my nostrils. I was kind of looking at this as a nice, gentle way to start off the night. What did I get myself into? Ah, I see. I got myself into a kick-ass IPA I've never heard of before. The taste is aggressively hopped, pleasantly oily, bitter, sharp, clean, & all the things a good IPA claims to be. Wow. First-class IPA. Really, really good. I could drink these all night. Thanks Mr. Hophead, I am going to put this on my wants list hoping people will drop a can or two in as extras.

The beer is a light amber color, but shows a brilliantly clear, orange / red tinged, full copper hue when held up to the light. The aroma is definitely hoppy, though not aggressively so, there is also a fair amount of malt character that accentuates a sticky hop character. Aromas of candied orange zest, ruby red grapefruit, caramelized oranges, some touches of pine and green herbal notes and, towards the finish, a touch of cracker like grain and lightly toasted malt. Slightly sweet, somewhat light bodied, but definitely hoppy. A nice bitterness clings to the palate and lingers for quite some time in a long, bitter, dry finish. Up front the bitterness takes on a decidedly herbal note with touches of hemp, biting pine flavors and a bit of herbal / green-grassy notes. This is definitely nice and quaffable, it is not overly sweet nor thick for an IPA, though the hop character definitely tends to cling to the palate. The first sips, as well as sips where I have gone and done something else for a while, have a much more prominent citrus hop character (with orange zest, grapefruit notes, kumquat and perhaps a touch of lychee); otherwise the herbal and bitter hop flavors dominate. The flavor is much more harsh and aggressive than the aroma suggested, but it will certainly still be enjoyable for the hop heads out there.

Appearance: Pours a healthy-looking clear orange amber-bodied brew. A mild pour coaxed a good one-plus finger white foamy head with above average staying power that leaves some sticky, creamy lacing as it fades away, sort of randomly thrown across the sides of the glass. Very good start. Aroma: Great west coast aroma. That one-two citrus-pine combo is so traditional for a reason - it smells great. This one's not overstated, and compliments the roasted, sticky, doughy malt backbone well. Taste: Expertly balanced. It's not too bitter or too malty, and the maltiness isn't too sweet or too dry. Hop profile is a little milder than I'd like, but more so than a lot of IPAs - I'm just very demanding of my hops, I suppose. Leafy floral notes, pine, and lots of grapefruit makes for a good hop profile. Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full bodied, fairly fluffy, but very even and creamy, precisely what you'd expect from the look of the head. Carbonation is precise and pronounced, a little prickly, and the hop oils increase the slickness factor ever so sightly. Drinkability: A great, drinkable, sessionable IPA in a can that hits all the right notes without knocking any of them out of the park. But that's not what you're looking for with this one.

6.1,10784,1075,Caldera IPA,American IPA,4,4,4.5,5,RedDiamond,4.5,"Caldera IPA is my new best friend. And I'm wondering if the can has something to do with it. For decades canned beer deserved the stigma attached to it. The aluminum adversely impacted the taste, lending a tawdry metallic quality that was the hallmark of industrial beer production. This problem has been solved in recent years by coating the inside of the can with a food-grade polymer that effectively keeps the beer off the aluminum. No more unsavory beer can taste. Today it's not merely a matter of acknowledging that canned beer ""works."" It's now prudent to ask whether it's an altogether better idea than beer in a bottle. And Caldera's IPA is a fine candidate for the notion that canned beer is an idea whose time has come. Caldera IPA's aroma is floral and leafy. The leaf is so fresh it's almost sticky. It imparts a tall airy head of majestic suds amid lively carbonation in a sunny topaz color. The body is vivid and clear though marred by a few wayward flocs. The taste reminds me of Fire Station 5 with perfectly posited bittering that takes your hand and walks you through a lush garden of herbal hop flavor. Piney, peachy elements interweave from an ideal balance of hop flavor and malty sustenance. And the mouthfeel is flawless - plush, meandering, and exquisitely quaffable. Even the head delights in its own fluffiness. An ideal go-to beer for any occasion.",1216685474

Poured a 12oz can into a snifter Appearance - Produced a creamy 1 finger head that lasted for quite a while before dissipating to a thick crown across the surface of the brew. Light lacing is left behind as the head shrinks. It is a hazy transparent golden orange color. Smell - Damn, this smells pretty awesome. The scent of candied orange explodes out of the glass. Almost like Sunkist orange soda spiked with hops - but without the artificial orange scent. Very bright. Citrus rind and sugar and the primary scents that I detect. Taste - The taste is nice, but nowhere near as nice as the scent. Citrusy hops and slight cracker-like malts make an appearance in the initial flavor, with a thin sugary sweetness in the middle and then runs flat - all before a surge of bitter hops rounds out the backend and aftertaste. It isn't balanced by any means - but it is tasty. If only it tasted as good as it smelled. Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is pretty nice. There is are tiny, very fine textured carbonation bubbles that prick the tip of your tongue as you sip, and then runs creamy by the time it hits the back of the throat. I would have enjoyed a little more carbonation in the backend to liven things up, but I always enjoy a beer that can be both crisp and creamy at the same time. Drinkability - This is a very solid brew. It is a nice, easy drinking beer, but I wish that it had a more balanced flavor - or at least a flavor that tasts as good as it smells. The hops seen to be a little out of whack - I would have enjoyed a more prevalent malt profile. But it smells awesome, and I do get my hop fix.

Poured a golden orange color with a creamy, two-inches of off-white head. Strings of lace were seen clinging to the sides of my glass. The nose was citrusy in a grapefruity sort of way, with some peppery notes. Definitely seemed like a WCIPA. A bit more herbal in the taste than in the nose, and there's a pineyness that didn't seem to come through in the aroma, all in addition to the citrus noted in the nose. Bone dry finish. While diverse in terms of hoppiness, the malts seem a little too anemic for the beer's own good, and the hops aren't beefy enough to be a true scorcher of an IPA. Fairly light bodied, though with a mouthfeel that is mildly slick with hop resin. A mediocre IPA. Beefing up the malts to provide a bit more counterpoint would improve it. Should I find myself in Ashland, I'll give this a try on tap. For now, I'm glad I tried it, but this won't make me switch from Laughing Dog's IPA (my local, go-to IPA)anytime soon.",1214181956

Mouthfeel is suitably bitter, but not near the max of the style, and has a nice dry finish--refreshing compared to many heavy, sugary IPAs in its class.

Really nicely balanced here. Gimme another quaff. This IPA goes down very, very easy. Drinkability: The perfect PNW Summer Session IPA.

6.1,10784,1075,Caldera IPA,American IPA,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,ccrida,3.5,"12 oz. can poured into a nonic, the Caldera's IPA is a clear bronze with a moderate sized white head that quickly fades to a thick skim, leaving scattered lace. Like their Pale Ale I just reviewed, this is the first time I've ever not had this beer in a can, but I'm not nearly as impressed. Served at fridge temp. Smell is pure, resiny cannabis - ah, Oregon! To be more specific, it's more of the cat piss style, which you probably won't care for unless you have the mental association. I was just working on my goggle tan at Mt. Ashland this past Wednesday, and by the number of heads goofing off with me on a work day, it's obvious this town operates on a slightly slower speed. With a smell like this, I think Caldera's trying to remind us there's always time to chill... Taste is pungent, resiny hops, firm malt backbone with a big bitter finish. The slightest touch of sweet caramel malt loses the battle to the big buds, which pack enough lupin to knock out Bobby Brown on a 3 day coke binge. Mouthfeel is creamy but dry and crisp, with a heavier body. Drinkability is average. I like a lot more hop flavor then bitterness, and this IPA is pretty much the opposite, and a bit thick for my taste as well.

A soft inch of foam quickly forms and trickles slowly to a thin layer, leaving behind some lacing on the side of the glass. Very decent hop aroma. There seems to be a good balance of citrus fruits and pine aromas. The traditional grapefruit is there along with some bitter orange and maybe some tangerine and nectarine. The toasted malt aromas and caramel tries to peek from behind the hops but so far it's mostly hops on top. A touch of bread dough and slightly spicy hops. Taste is of bitter citrus, citrus zest, and pine with a slightly metallic flavor in the finish. Toasted malts and toasted bread with just a hint of caramel make up the malt backbone.

Aromas are very earthy, and resin like. There is also a hint of hard candy sweetness. Very nice nose on this one. Beer has a very hoppy flavor to it. Mostly like the aromas, earthy and resin like, with some pine like flavors as well. There is a bit of subtle underlying creamy malts, and a finish that is crisp, tart, and bitter.

As it warms more of a complex earthiness with mild tree bark notes ring out but underneath all those hops a subtle layer of malt sugars arise bringing out sweet candy like notes. Flavor is upfront with brash bitterness yet enough malt sweetness comes out to party, this is west coast style IPA all the way. Hop bitterness reigns supreme with grapefruit citrus peel bitterness and more of that earthy dirt layer coming through. Mouthfeel the hop bitterness consumes your palate it really sticks around it makes you feel like you have to scrape the hops off your tongue, I love it. Once again I love the can format, this is great to get this much hop flavor out of a near 6%abv brew coming right out of a can. Next time I hit up an outdoor event where drinking takes place I will remember this beer and wish I had at least a case on hand. Very green yet biscuit malts and mild caramel twang make so drinkable the palate gets used to those brash bittering hops and adjusts to all the other flavors my palate has a found it's equilibrium and no shit this is an outstanding IPA in a can.

I opted for the DFH pint glass here and the ale pours out a crystal clear orange with a copper grapefruit hue. A white two-finger head tops off a good looking beer. Nice lacing. Tantilizing bouquet: floral and perfumey hops accented by a strong citrus presence. The overall effect of hops and malt is sweet and tangy. Flavors are nicely balanced with just a slight bent towards the hoppy side. Orange and grapefruit mingle with spicy and floral and it's all about centennial hops. Whatever it's hop makeup, it's tasty. It's weighty on the palate with a somewhat grainy texture and ample carbonation. I could drink this regulary, it's damn good and I'm tempted to compare it to Two Hearted Ale. Seriously.",1203382386

With Surly, Caldera, and others now proving that canned beer can be as good or better than bottles, I tihnk in another 5 years the market will explode. Brick/rusty orange flows into my pint glass from the brightly designed can. Smaller head, though the lacing sticks to the side of my glass with tenacity. Aroma is a bit weak compared to other PacNW IPA's. However, after the brew warmed up a bit, there was a noticable improvement in the strength. Noticed hops of course. More sweet florals that other IPAs. Grapefruit, lemon, cannabis. Flavor was superb. For the first second, I notice a sweet smoothness. Then the hops set in and I am awash in bitter pine and citrus. Again, cannabis notes as well. The finish has caramel and bitter earthen/soil characteristics. I really like this one, and get no metallic or other ""can""-like flavors. (not that I expected to).

6.1,10784,1075,Caldera IPA,American IPA,4,4.5,4.5,4,BuckeyeNation,4,"Polished brew kettle coppery orange with butter rum edges. The good looking crown is some combination of ivory, ecru and pale orange. It has the look and leaves the lace of a beer that contains a generous amount of hop resins. At least I hope so. The nose is nicely hoppy, but it isn't explosively hoppy. I blame the fact that the brewers decided to use too much Munich and crystal at the expense of pale malt. The hops (Crystal, Galena, and Centennial) provide grapefruit and orange esters, along with a strong whiff of ganja. Close to excellent, but no cigar. Edit: by the last ounce... cigar. I feel the same way about the flavor... at least after two mouthfuls. Who knows what time, warming and the rest of the can might accomplish? These guys definitely love to hop their beer, but then that's almost a requirement in Oregon, isn't it? I wish the website listed the IBUs. I'm thinking 70ish. The sturdy malt backbone, again, contains a healthy amount of toasted earthiness from the Munich and steely caramel from the crystal. It also provides an underlying sweetness that keeps things from being more arid on the back end than they already are. Caramel-soaked orange and grapefruit pith and peel zings across the tongue with each mouthful, leaving shallow alpha acid furrows rather than deep trenches. The mouthfeel is IPA medium; perhaps a bit more full due to a wonderful creaminess as it gains a few degrees. The amount and feel of the carbonation strikes me as just about right. Are all 12 ounces gone already? Prior to Surly blowing the entire concept sky-high, Caldera Pale Ale was my favorite canned beer. IPA is at least as good. It's a terrific, drinkable beer that I have no trouble recommending to anyone, hophead or not. If you have a few slots to fill in your Liquid Solutions order, you could do much worse than to fill them with either Caldera Pale Ale or Caldera IPA.",1194792567

Fair amount of sweetness up front, along with a decent blast of citrusy, floral and slightly piney hops. Seems to fade into a bit of grassy flavor as well. Very nice. Good body, very easy to drink.

Smell- Big floral hop smacks me right in the face, this smells like a nice fresh IPA. Smells like there is a decent amount of malt on this one to balance as well. Taste- Rich fluffy hops and a very nice light malt bringing in the rear. This is a nice balanced IPA, there is a bit of metallic can character as well. Mouthfeel- The metallic flavor comes in and lingers on the mouthfeel. The carbonation seems to wear down quite a bit as well. Still a medium bodied, crisp beer.

A beer that when you take a sip the head sticks on your mouth for a foam mustache. Thick completely engulfing lace completely down the glass. Damn I love the canned beers. Fresh smack of in your face hops. Lovely floral tones with a piney aspect with a hint of stone fruits. A thick caramel toffee really brings things together and adds a sense of sweetness to the aroma. Very floral and perfumey on the finish. Slightly lacking on the mid palate and on the finish a gritty almost metallic hop bitterness. Caramel malt rests behind the floral tones and could be a little more pronounced. A bit of peach and blood orange also say hello. Mouth is lacking the creamy thickness that more malting could have brought and it dissapoints. This beer just barely misses from being great, otherwise a very solid IPA.",1190238782

That lemon-yellow package, though new on the maket, is already easy to spot... Another classic phrase regarding keeping the beer at a proper temperature: ""Live Product. Keep Cool, Just Like You"". A: Pours a light amber color and immaculately clear with almost 4-fingers of billowing sandy tan-colored head. Fades to about 1/2-finger. What remains is both rocky and creamy, full of both bubbles and crust. Hardly any carbonation and a faint suspended haziness. S: Aroma is all citrus, full of pithy grapefruit and traces of lemon and sweeter orange. What caramel malt there is is folded into a neat envelope of juicy hops. T: Pithy bitterness sprays from this IPA from the first taste. There is very little malt getting through here; this is an fairly unbalanced hop explosion. Lots of grapefruit bitterness and pine resin - very little caramel malt or other sweetness getting through. M: Medium mouthfeel, but with a long-lasting hoppy cling. This has orange, grapefruit and pine nesting on the center and back of the tongue. Carbonation is low and somehow the mouthfeel is fleeting and just a little thin. D: A good IPA, certainly worthy of grabbing one (or a 6-pack) if in Oregon.

S - Fairly strong aroma that can be smelled 18"" away. Sweet malt, citrus and hop floral. T - Much like the aroma. Sweet bread and fruit followed by a dash of orange flesh a touch of spice and finally orange rind bitterness doesn't dominate. A pleasant, well-balanced bitter-sweet taste although it doesn't blow my hair back. M - Medium body and carbonation. A bit syrupy with some prickle O - I enjoyed this brew.

The finish is dry and bitter with a pronounced grapefruit flavor, as well as a some bell pepper. M: Medium body, crisp medium-high carbonation, dry finish. This IPA has bite but is still very drinkable. Could be due to a slightly low ABV. O: I thought this was a very very good IPA. Definitely my favorite in a can so far. Not a bad price either.

Smell is strong citrus and grapefruit rind. This is a great smelling beer. Taste is piney and grapefruity with slight sugar. Mouthfeel is very clean for such a big hop brew. Not sticky at all. Very quaffable. Overall I would have to give this a 4 even though it's really in the 4.12 range. Only reason not to give it a 4.5 is the cost of this stuff. 16 dollars in Ky.,1314517713

Supporting toasted malt makes an appearance, too. Mild herbal notes in the background. Moderate level of toasted malts, herbal hops, medium level of bitterness.

Taste: hoppy with a bitter flavor that is similar to a nice dark (I mean real dark) chocolate the most obvious taste is grapefruit, but there is also bright,garden fresh green pepper hint.

Right next to G'Night (Gordon) as the best beer from a can...I gave my son a can and even his collage buddies who don't like IPA's said it was amazing.

Taste is really good similar to the nose with a nice pine finish, sticky and resiny with a full bitterness. Mouthfeel is perfect: medium carbonation and medium body.

Honeyed biscuits and spicy hops in nose. Clean, understated and balanced. Calderas website says this was brewed with Centennial, Simcoe and Amarillo -- which has me confused, because my taste buds are calling these hops earthy and spicy, with none of the usual snap of American-grown hops. Perhaps its the abundance of malt throwing things off theres a lot of toasty biscuits, bread and uncooked pale barley before the clean, dry finish. The medium body exhibits a very light touch of carbonation and soft silky fizziness. Lightly bitter. I found Calderas IPA very similar to their pale, with maybe a half step up in each category. While both beers are enjoyable enough, they lack the hoppy bite I crave in American-brewed versions of this style.",1311635580

The foam sticks to the glass and the lacing is decent. Smell - I get hops, some grapefruit and some pine. It's more of a biscuit malt aroma, though. Kinda smells like an ESB. Taste - Hops at first, more pine in the flavor than in the smell. Malty behind it. Biscuit malts and a touch of caramel. Not sweet at all, but malty nonetheless. Tastes like an ESB, too. Mouthfeel - Just a tad heavier than medium bodied. Feels heavier because of low carbonation. Has the feel of an ESB, too! Overall - Not as hoppy as I would like from an IPA.

Pours from the can into a pint glass an amber color with a nice, one inch size and very foamy head with great retention and lacing. Taste is pretty darn spot on. Slightly sweet up front with plenty of hop flavor and hop bitterness at the end. There seems to be a bit of alkalinity that adds some artificial and chalky bitterness that keep this one from being a classis. As it is, this is a real winner.

6.1,10784,1075,Caldera IPA,American IPA,4,3,4,4,beagle75,3.5,"Poured from a 12 oz. can into a shaker pint glass. A: Very clear, light amber color with over one finger of off-white foam head. Heavy lacing remains on the glass, showing striking relief near the top of the glass. S: Peppery and astringent herbaceous hops suggest dryness, with lesser tropical and citrus fruit also detected. T: Begins dry, with earthy black pepper that seems to be associated with the aromatic hops from the smell. Esters are barely detectable, blending in with and complementing the hops. The fruit flavors give off a funky tropical quality, like durian. Acidity is restrained--detectable but never distracting. Husky toasted grain becomes more assertive in the middle, and moderate bitterness develops in the finish amidst continuing malt and slightly astringent hops. M: Medium viscosity, smooth and slightly sticky on the palate, with very low carbonation. D/O: It seems like many of the IPAs made by the smaller production breweries struggle almost predictably with some facet of the style--all in the pursuit to be unique in order to stand apart from the pack. This contribution from Caldera is fairly unique in its qualities, but it manages to stay appealing. Its abv is on the low side of the normal range for the style, adding to its approachable nature. Look for interesting pepper and off-center tropical fruit, but don't expect anything too extreme--this is a beer that still aims to please.",1306940546

Not anything surprising or breath taking. No real note supercedes the rest. Faint hints of orange and citrus fade to a very faint sign of pine on the end.

From can to pint glass A: Pours a darker caramel color pale with some orange tints to it. Massive khaki tan head due to bad pour on my part but sticky icky lacing fo' sure! S: Instant pop of the top is burst of sweet mango and tangerine aromas. Candied orange rinds. Is this a friggin orange soda? I cant get over the smells of citrus oils here. Best fruity and floral nose in an IPA I have come across in a while. Better than Flower Power maybe. T: Taste is intense hop bitterness that is just danky hops, resiny pine, and blasts of citrus. Grassy and sassy. I love it! Malts hardly detectable at first but the hops do settle down fairly quickly and give way to this sweet caramelly malt goodness. Soft caramel and sweet cracker. Nice bittery dry finish. Delciousness out of a can. M: Sticky resinous hops do coat the tongue but overall pretty creamy in texture and peppers out the palate on the finish. D: Pretty damn nice IPA out of a can I must say. Snowboarding, camping, fishing...they all just got even better. More please. All I got to say is I need to get up to Oregon.",1305154329

Malt sweetness is also detectable in the nose. Taste is grassy, piny, spicy. Assertive but balanced, caramel malt is present. Big merit on drinkability, a simple and flavorful IPA. Finishes clean, nice and smooth. This would be a great ""every day"" IPA, but I guess, so would Pliny.",1305061090
6.1,10784,1075,Caldera IPA,American IPA,4,4,4,4.5,MaltsOfGlory,4,"The look of this is pretty freaking nice, the coolest part about the look is the contrast between the head and the body. The head is almost completely white, and the body is a reddish, orangey, amber color, it looks more like an amber than an IPA, but the head color and body color look really nice together. I can tell the head is a solid one, it is clearly leaving good lacing, it didn't hang around too long though. If it had better head retention I would probably give this a 4.5, but since that head went a little fast, 4. Nice citrusy hops on the nose, along with a very clean smell. The beer just smells super clean and fresh, like they used really good water or something. You can also pick up a nice malt note in there, it is pretty distant, but for sure there. Maybe some grapefruit in here too, not sure. The smell is very nice though, it smells like a very good IPA. Well on the taste, it for sure has enough hops, it's not a weak IPA, that's for sure. The taste is really just like I detected it would be on the smell, it's really big on the hops, and it has a very small malt note in the back end. Frankly I'm surprised at how much more hop there is than malt, I guess I just haven't had a really good (or hoppy, if you will) IPA in a while. Not super complex other than the basic tastes, but it is super well done none the less. The mouthfeel is also pretty good, nice solid feel to it, not too big, not too small, just right. Drinkability is a little low just because it is so damn bitter, but I can't be upset about that, that just means it's a good beer! Overall a damn good beer, not extraordinarily complex, but a very well done beer, there is really nothing wrong with this beer at all.",1304497206

Pineapple and mango DOMINATE the aroma. I dont smell any citrus or pine. Some maltiness is pressent, but the fruit dominate the aroma profile for me. T - Piny and resiny hop flavors mixed with less prominant citrus and pineapple. The flavors are very crisp and clean. The sweetness that i smelled is not as present as i expected. Very well balanced. M - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Well balanced hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Fairly sticky from the resiny hops. O - A great IPA. The aroma is second to none and it helps that it drinks as well as it smells. Its just high enough in ABV that i wouldn't want to session this beer.

Taste: Muted grassy hops, orange, balanced well with sweet malt and finishes dry. Mouthfeel: Medium-light feel to it with mild carbonation. Overall: Not a bad brew overall, but not great either. Checking Caldera's site on this, it claims to have an assertive hop profile and 94 IBUs. I'm thinking this can traveled a long way and sat for quite some time before being sold to me, because I am not picking up much bitterness or hops. Someone could have told me this was a pale ale with IBUs around 50-60, and I would have believed it.

A normal IPA nose, but done well. The taste is that of a well-done, well-balanced IPA. The malts and hops are quite harmonious, neither taking over too far.

D: This is a great IPA that presents a powerful hops profile. This is up there with my favorite IPAs, and the boldness of its big bitter taste despite its canned presentation is a refreshing sight.

6.1,10784,1075,Caldera IPA,American IPA,3,3.5,4,3,generalnotsew,2.5,I got a nice head on the pour but the coloring is a much lighter and watery looking amber color than that is expected of most IPA's. The smell is pretty nice. Mostly sweet pineapple but the hops aren't that noticeable. Very sugary as well. But I do have to give it points for being pretty strong in the nose even if it isn't showing bitterness. The bitterness is fairly sharp in the front but it fades into a kind of cheapish sweet corn and cereal like lager. Aftertaste also leaves a lot to be desired. Actually after the initial bitterness there really isn't much other flavor besides the corn and more bitterness. Pretty one dimensional. A bit too overcarbonated and kind of leaves a bad feel in your mouth. Well it is easy drinking. I can give it that. Heard a lot of good things about this beer. It failed to impress me. No canned/best by date so who knows how fresh it is. At $12 a six pack this beer is total fail! I didn't even see the price til it rang up and I thought it was a mistake and had to look at the screen to make sure. Even if it was pretty good that price is pretty bad.,1299990272

Preface, I can recall many a pleasant afternoons spent in SE Portland drinking this at Otto's accompanied by a smoked sausage. A- Golden amber color with a whitish head. Not sure if I dropped the can before pouring, but the head was two and half fingers when poured moderately. Reduces to a firm thorough covering the lasts. Plenty of lacing on the glass. No visible carbonation bubbles. S- Hops! Complex mixture of grapefruit, grassy, and herbal tones. Not much malt. Very very hop forward. T- Wish it tasted like it smelled minus the grassy aroma. Bitter at the front and end. I taste white onion throughout. It is quite the hop wallop, but the onion seems to be the main taste (had nothing to eat before tasting, so no lingering food tastes). Minus the onion, I think this would be dead on. M- Medium body with minimal carbonation. Dry finish on the tongue. Lingers bitter with that onion taste. D- Still would drink it for nostalgia reasons alone, but it holds up. Perfect for mowing the lawn or a softball game. It is easy to drink.",1299614816

A bit of resin. Nice balanced malty backbone, toasted, earthy and bitter through and though M - Weed and resin! Puckers the whole mouth with glorious bitterness and a bit of sweet at the end. Sticky and lingers for a long while D - This is not your average IPA. This is a hop and bitterness beast. Amazing smells and tastes, but if you are frightened of bitters, stay away.

Appearance: Pours a darker-than-straw honey color, with some hop haze and carbonation visible. Retained about a finger of off-white rocky head. Very true to the style in appearance. Smell: Nothing overwhelming but nothing off here, either. Hops, citrus, some grassy-floral componenets as well. To me the malts took a back seat, without letting the hops being overwhelming or one-dimensional. Soft-smelling, I would call it. Taste & mouthfeel: Essentially the same as the nose, with a grapefruit-like flavor as the main culprit. Hop bitterness makes your tongue tingle initially, and the sharp grapefruit levels out into a slight lingering bitterness. The malts are light and toasty but seem distant. Again, a little 'soft' but not one-dimensional. The mouthfeel is extremely crisp and it dries you out on the back end. I consider this a light bodied beer. Disgustingly drinkable. Edit to Note: I was just getting over a cold when I tried this, so I will re-review in the future. If this really is as bitter and hop-forward as some of the other reviewers are saying, I will be upping my grade for this beer.",1299091519

The Caldera is not available in Illinois at this point, so I was excited to try a new West Coast IPA and this was no disappointment. APPEARANCE: Brilliant gold-copper in color with a quarter-inch, very homogeneous and bubbly, white head. Not bad retention, as it slowly faded over the course of a minute or so. SMELL: Pine and floral aromas dominate the smell, but mild malt and grapefruit smells are present as well. TASTE: This is a hoppy, bitter beer and it is delicious. The hops dominate from start to finish in this beer and balance is a relative term in this case, however, there are enough grapefruit and floral flavors to ensure that the hops don't completely destroy the palate. Very dry all the way through, particularly in the aftertaste. MOUTHFEEL: Well carbonated, the Caldera sparkles from start to finish while it dries and bitters the whole way through. DRINKABILITY: This is what a West Coast IPA is supposed to be all about - bold, bitter and biting. This is not a beginner beer, it is for the seasoned hop head who can appreciate every IBU packed into this brew.",1298841962

Thick spotted lacing climbing down various sides of the glass. S - A large upfront hit of citrus with some pine notes hiding behind some sweet caramel malt essence. T - Right of the bat, a major hit of citrus with a follow up of some semi-sweet flavor (pineapple). Mildly sweet malty transition to the finish with a late note of Piney Hop(s) and lemon. M - Nice body, slightly above average in carbonation, but seems to be missing a little in the transition from introduction to finishing edge, I suppose the ""carryover."" D - By far the best canned IPA I've had to date, especially for the price. Certainly drinkable and pretty hoppy. I like the start and finish but was left wanting just a little more in the middle. Overall a pretty decent beer and easy to enjoy as a ""session"" beer. My prescription: Get it if you can and try a few.

Very smooth on the tongue, taste of dark malts, and chocolate coated macaroons....which again, I do not like, but in beer form it translated so well.

Pretty sure I've had this before... Here's the description from Caldera's website for this year-round offering: ""A conundrum in the world of beer styles. This ale does not fit any conventional beer style. Orange in color, this beer has hop characteristics of oranges and tangerines. Grist: Premium Two Row, Crystal; Hops: Amarillo, Cascade, Horizon; Original gravity: 1.052; Alcohol by volume: 5.4%."" A: Beautiful, slightly hazy honey-orange color. Light to moderate fast-rising carbonation. Topped with a creamy, off-white head, about 1-1/2 fingers, gently fading. Good lace. S: Malty caramel, a touch sweet. A piercing hop sting - definitely orange/citrus-smelling. T: More toffee-maltiness than I'd expected, but offset with that 'orange' pith taste the hops contribute. What starts sweeter ends more on the side of bitterness. Good flavors and nicely balanced overall. M: Creamy, medium mouthfeel, carbonation seems a little light. Ends with a little sticking malt and a slightly metallic hop bite on the back of the tongue. This analogy may sound weird, but it felt like a quarter was being pressed down on my tongue...

This brew works well. It is dry and hoppy as the name suggests, and the orange doesn't ruin this by making it too sweet. Think peel rather than juice.

The smell is mild and fruity, as much from the dry hopped cascade(?) as the passion fruit it seems. Not bad, but more restrained then I expected. The taste is bitter sweet, a little grainy, not much hops and a touch of passionfruit. Basically drinks like a pale ale, not as fruity or tart as I was expecting. While I didn't want a daiquiri, I could have used more of the ""real passion fruit puree"" that this was made with. The mouthfeel was quite nice, creamy and very light without being watery. This was pretty drinkable, mainly due to the light body and borderline bland taste. I, however, like my beers have to some punch to them taste wise, and didn't find that here.",1185477411

Well, I'm a little disappointed in the flavor. The hops are definitely taking a back seat to the malt. No doubt, there are hops in the blend, but the malt is more forward, so it does follow the aroma fairly closely. The mouthfeel is of a medium thickness.

With obvious nods from the ruby color, this has a much more roasty character to the malt- toasted grain and apricot aromas- while the bigtime hops add a lot of floral, grapefruity tones as well as a faint touch of cheesy pungency. Unfortunately, with the darker roast on the malt making a bigger overall impression on the aroma profile, the beer seems to be having an identity crisis- losing complexity in the process. The palate mostly mirrors the nose, with the bigger malt character bumping elbows with the hoppiness. Starts medium bodied and creamy, with an instant blast of hop bitterness- flavors of apricot, toasted grain and red grapefruit- while the toastiness and bitterness roll right on through the finish. If there's such a style as a Red IPA, then maybe this clears the bar. But as a standard IPA, this completely misses for me. Plainly stated, IPAs should scream hops, and I really don't like it when the malt tries to turn it into a screaming match.

T: Begins off-dry, with malt-focused flavors of toasted bread and caramel that increase in sweetness. Hop aromatics are floral but muted. Astringency emerges in the middle as acidity peaks at a moderate level. The finish possesses diminishing qualities encountered earlier, mainly floral hops and esters, with moderate bitterness. M: Medium viscosity, slightly sticky on the palate, with moderate carbonation. D: If a brewery that cans most of their product puts a beer in a bottle, does that mean it's special? In this case, the answer is no. It is a very malt-focused IPA that features an underwhelming smell and some rough flavor edges. Ultimately Caldera's standard IPA wins out, with this beer as a hybrid IPA/DIPA that just lacks characteristic abv and hop intensity.

Review is from notes on 10/16/10. A: Pours a dark gold, bordering on amber with a tint of orange into a snifter. A half finger khaki head vanishes quickly, leaving a washboard film pattern on top. Thin, straight lines of carbonation move slowly up the glass. Small dotty lacing with a couple of arches is moderately sticky. S: I am not sure when this was bottled, but caramel malts are edging out the Centennial hops in my nose. Sweeter citrus notes of orange and lime and a dry, bitter hop character exist in the background. A hint of spiciness is also evident. T: The malt to hop balance is better than I thought it would be. Caramel malts are the dominant flavor, but citrus hops and nice dry pine and grassy hoppiness on the finish provide a counterpoint to the malts. M: This is a solid medium feel for an IPA with a coating sensation from the copious malt presence. The finish is a drying hop suck on the sides of my palate. D: HK is not my ideal IPA with the citrus hop notes a bit of an afterthought in the taste, but it is still pretty tasty. I do not think I would seek this out again, but I did enjoy drinking it.

There is a bit of a grassy hop smell as well. It tastes much like the smell. It initially tastes strongly of orange and other citrus fruits. An earthy slightly floral hop flavor is also present. A substantial amount of caramel sweetness balances the beer. A bitter aftertaste is present. This is a pretty generic tasting DIPA. The carbonation is moderate low. The drinkability is ok. I can finish this bottle easily but the heavy caramel malt quality of this beer would limit how much of the beer I would want to drink. Overall this is a pretty good beer.

A small ring of lacing made of large bubbles is left after the head recedes. Some scattered streams of carbonation are visible in the glass. Smell: I was expecting more in the way of hop aroma, but the bottle did sit a while, so perhaps that has something to do with it. There is some fairly decent citrus and pine notes, as well as some grainy malt aroma and a bit of something musty in the background. There is also a touch of spice present; almost reminiscent of a saison-type influence. Taste: There is definitely more bitterness than the smell leads on. The flavor is pretty well balanced with a decent malt profile. There's not a ton of complexity here, but it is a pretty decent representation of the style. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, creamy texture, with some biting pine notes. Fairly dry finish, and there's definitely some lingering bitterness there.

Seemed to be chinook, cascade and centennial combo, maybe with some willamette's thrown in for good measure. At times the bitterness just overshadows anything going on. Really, I can't see this being worth delving into the bottle world, it doesn't add anything that I can't get in the can for an ipa.

And ugh, it has a vegetative quality to it that just does not work at all for me, almost like leafy greens. Some sweet malts also lurking around the edges. T - Luckily not very similar to the nose. It's definitely on the sweeter side of IPAs, with plenty of bitterness from the hops but not a lot of the flavor that I've some to expect. It's okay but nothing spectacular, just very average. Not much in the way of detectable alcohol. M - Thick and full-bodied. Long dry finish. Definitely one of the best aspects of the beer. D - ABV isn't too high, but the aroma and taste just aren't doing it for me. I doubt I'd reach for another. O - Very much a mixed bag, with some great attributes -- look and feel -- and some bad ones. Unfortunately this beer fails for me on the keys -- smell and taste. I know Caldera can do better.",1283789454
6.8,56071,1075,Hopportunity Knocks,American IPA,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,JohnGalt1,3.5,22 picked up yesterday at the COOP.. Poured into my Old Guardian goblet.... pretty deep cloudy orange verging on amber.. nice enough 1 finger off white head has pretty good retention and lacing. Nose is pithy grapefruit hops and some back ground floral hoppiness... the pale malts are pretty prevalent.. so is some toasty malts. Pretty big up front.. bitter and bracing citrus hops move slowly but surely into pale malts that push the grapefruit back out into the middle... the toasted malts show toward the finish and combine with the biting hops... grassy floral elements show with warmth. Body (and hops) verge on DIPA territory... carbonation is good but it doesn't scrape away the toasty malts that I find a bit distracting. Good.. but not great.... 3.5/3.5/3.5/4/3.5,1283223460

Slightly golden, amber body with an off white two finger rocky head. Good lacing and head retention. A clean piney hop fragrance dominates the nose. Also some floral notes, a slight grapefruit citrus scent, and a caramel like sweetness. The taste is of toasty caramel malts, some bread, a bit of butterscotch, bitter tobacco resin, minty pine, and a slight dash of grapefruit citrus. The flavors just don't seem to come together very well though. Fairly hefty body, not much carbonation, bitter finish, but not really dry. A nice creaminess though. An east coast style IPA from an Oregon brewery. Pretty solid, but not really my favorite kind of IPA.",1282094906
6.8,56071,1075,Hopportunity Knocks,American IPA,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,rand,4,"From bomber to pint glass 08/10/10 A: Pours a deep orange-copper with a 1 inch, mocha-colored head. Appears quite oily and dense for the style and the carbonation looks like it's struggling to escape. Lots of foamy lacing. S: Citrusy grapefruit aroma and lots of pine. There is a faint sweetness in the backdrop, but the overall nose seems a little dampened. T: Bitter, grapefruity hops crash the palate, balanced by a touch of bready, slightly sweet malts. The hops are powerful here but they work well against the honey sweetness. There's some orange and lemon zest in there, and the alcohol has a warming effect halfway through each sip. As the beer warms, grassy, earthy, almost floral flavors can be detected. The beer finishes pleasantly bitter and dry. M: This is a fairly rich, chewy beer and could pass for a DIPA in its texture. The carbonation is perfect for this style and nicely washes away each sip. The taste is much more vibrant than the nose, and I wonder if that's due in part to its oily, full-bodied composition. D: This is a total hop-bomb, but as your palate adjusts to the aggressively bitter hop profile you'll find this brew quite balanced. I noticed myself drinking faster as I was writing this review. Notes: Overall, quite impressive. This could easily pass for a California IPA and could stand up against some of the better known hop monsters coming out of SoCal. I'm really particular about IPA's and fairly skeptical about unknown renditions, but after finishing a pint I'm surprising satisfied.This is the first offering I've sampled from Caldera and they've passed my IPA test with flying colors, so they'll be on my radar.",1281519201

Hazy amber with a thin eggshell head. Mild lacing left gossamer strands clinging to the sides of the glass. Loads of sweet toffee malt and some big piney hops in the nose. Slightly out of balance with a bit much malt. Initial toasted malt blooms into an explosion of biscuit in the middle, with a big hops bittereness at the end. Bitter for the sake of bitter. Doesn't bring any of the pleasant citrus, piney, grassy hop flavors, just bitterness. Medium light mouthfeel, finishes very quickly. Drinkability is just average.

6.8,56071,1075,Hopportunity Knocks,American IPA,4.5,4,3.5,4,augustgarage,4,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. Kind of a creepy label with big hop cones banging down your door out in space... SAE/ECE Amber liquid, not quite clear with brighter amber highlights. A pale buff/cream crown of soft peaks recedes to a lasting finger, leaving behind crazed webs of fine sticky lacing. Brewed with 100% Centennial hops at all stages and this shows - the signature C-hop bitterness is hinted at in the aromatics along with a blast of citrus, spicy evergreen, and floral scents. The palate is likewise suffused with whole-cone dank hemp-y goodness with hints of orange zest, grapefruit, and an almost cedar-like woody/earthy element that is at least as much a contribution of the hardy (hearty?) malt backbone as it is derived from the hops - an unapologetically NW-style IPA, malt forward with a suggestion of wet stones and cocoa in the bitter, fruity finish. Medium-full bodied, oily, almost sticky mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a touch of warmth from the alcohol. Some astringency in the finish makes it a sipper, and overall I think it does better with food (grilled salmon comes immediately to mind) than all on its lonesome. Not as well balanced as their regular canned IPA, but that isn't the point of this series.",1278984978

Plenty of webbed lacing and a solid skim coat on the surface for the duration of the glass. Aromatics are laced with dank tangerine, pine, caramel, and grapefruit. Somewhat pungent. Sweet malt follows through. Medium bodied with a slightly chewy, tacky mouthfeel. A bit grippy. Plump malt and pithy tangerine lead off the palate. Pine-rubbed grapefruit and a firm bitterness step forward. Plenty of dank, herbaceous resins. Almost woodsy. Finishes with a lingering, drying bitterness that balances the sweet malt and plenty of chewy resins. Tasty one.

Smell - The nose is of heavy caramel and malt, slightly bitter grapefruit, hops, other citrus such as orange peel, and slight piney and floral scents. Taste - More balanced than I would have thought. A hoppy citrus burst up front that becomes more bitter the more you drink the beer as it warms. This is then oddly encapsulated by a heavy malty, caramel backbone. So I guess the overall product in sum is balanced but in reality as this beer warms up there are two extremes to it. Mouthfeel - Moderate body, oily slick hops, medium carbonation. Drinkability - I'll put this in the ""somewhat"" category. Knowing I have a Blind Pig waiting for me after this makes me realize that this is not as drinkable as one would expect. Now, give me 10 Blind Pigs in a row and I will still ask for more. They are right around the same ABV but this beer just doesn't leave me craving more of it.

Strong pink grapefruit, cantaloupe rind, with the strong crystal malt flavour, bordering on amber ale. M: Fairly light-bodied in this style, soft carbonation, moderate aftertaste.

The aroma is very complex with plenty of pine and citrus hops, but also some toasty roasty malt character that is not overpowering and quite nice. The flavor follows the same path. Very bitter with a huge citrus and pine punch to the taste buds, as well as a groin kick of roasted and caramel malt. I have to say, I thought this was just a normal IPA, but it seems to be leaning a bit more towards an American strong ale/Black IPA in flavor. Astringency and bitterness fight a battle royal in my mouth, and I am lucky enough to have a front row seat. The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium, and has one of those sticky/dry finishes that are common in beers of this gravity and hop load.

Very nice head, but the body's a bit dark and murky for an IPA. Smell is skunky, some citrus, earthy spice too. Nice floral sweetness, but not the blistering hops I expected from the label. Taste is pretty citrusy, spicy hops, but not to strong. Big bready malt backbone, moderate bitterness, definitely on the malty side or an IPA, more like a hoppy amber or pale ale. Marketed as such, I'd have scored it higher. I don't really like big malty IPAs. Mouthfeel is slick and oily, there's a thinness to this, almost cask like, in spite of the chewiness of the malt.

Its rare that you stumble across something that can easily replace a standard with such ease. Nothing in this beer is overstated, but the smooth combination of dry, tart and peat, with a slight fruitiness in just the right amount for a sweet compliment. This is a stellar seasonal, and I hope they keep the recipe. I would not change a single thing. There seems to be confusion over what this beer is. Caldera's ""site"" says that it changes by season.

One thumb of puffy foam; it starts to dissipate quickly. Tiny granules of lace follow the beer with each sip; many slide right down the glass. Smells ok; floral hops and hint of leafy hops are blocked by a strong caramel and doughy bread combo. Hmm; perhaps this isn't the freshest. The flavor profile is set up in a similar manner. There is a decent showing of hops, but they are floral and delicate; bitterness is very low. Perhaps a subtle nip of pine here and there. Solid caramel and bread backdrop, but the hops aren't pushed aside. Around medium body with rolling carbonation. Finishes pretty clean. This is a pleasant drinking amber ale. I'd like to try it super fresh at some point.",1317255653

Really lovely amber hue with reddish highlights, pure white head leaving a gorgeous lace. Initially comes off metallic, (after enjoying their pale ale), but second sip doesn't have that issue. Lots of bright fruit, bready yeast and malt notes, hint of English style hops and caramel. Really stunning if not overly complex nose. Richly flavored with emphasis on the malts. Really nice caramel streak with apple, fig, bread, and nutty notes. Gorgeous. Texture is wonderful, superb grip and wonderful intensity of flavor. Medium to long finish, great balance.

T: Delicious blend of the sweet and bready malt flavors with (mostly) piney hops. Finishes on the dry side with pine flavors lingering.

Apricot, apple juice, sweet honey-baked biscuits. More sweet than bready. The flavor seems at first as if it'll be majorly hoppy, with lots of earthy, spicy bitterness. Fruit soon takes over, however, with honey drizzled apple slices. Its almost like apple or apricot pie, with malt delivering the buttery crust. The slightly drying finish leaves lingering toasted biscuit notes. Medium-light body, soft carbonation but moderate fizziness. Caldera has themselves a very drinkable amber here.

I can tell the malts are there, but I don't really pick them up directly. The initial hop hit after the pour is really nice, with a decent amount of citrus and some pine. After that, it fades, leaving mostly light aromatics. Taste is a good balance, with no flavors really pushing out from the pack. A solid blend of tangy light malts and gentle barely-bitter hops pretty much all the way through. I like the flavor, I just wish it were more persistent. It disappears rather quickly, leaving some grassy hop flavors for a short time before they're gone completely. Very little bitterness anywhere in the taste.

The head is pretty much totally white, where as the body is a standard amber color, there are hughes of orange in here as well, the beer is see through is some areas, but for the most part completely non transparent. it looks ok, nothing special. The smell leads me to think that I'm not going to like the beer, it's all malt on the smell, almost no hops to speak of, and an amber ale should have some hops in there. Not only that, but the malt smells like it's the kind of malt I really don't like, the malt that tastes like it smells before you even brew the beer, just a complete grain taste. We will see, but the smell doesn't give me high hopes. Well on the first taste I took I couldn't really detect any hops, and frankly I thought the beer was extremely boring on the first taste. However, on the second and third sips, the hops are coming out a little bit more. The malts are for sure not too bad, they aren't really the kind of bad taste I was detecting on the smell. This is a very drinkable beer, and not bad by any means, but I frankly wish there was more taste to it. On some tastes this beer deserves a 4, but on others it deserves a 3.5, so I dunno. The taste just isn't as bold and powerful as it could be, but it is crisp and refreshing, and it does have some nice flavors to it. The mouthfeel isn't too bad, a little thin, but it does have some girth to it, not too bad. Overall a good beer, not amazing, but good. Frankly I can't find anything too wrong with it other than the smell, but I guess it just wasn't hitting on all cylinders for me, for some reason.

Pours a bright clear copper hue with fluffy eggshell white head of 2 cm foaming up. Fades at a steady pace leaving some large lattice on the glass and creating some large craters in the foam. Relatively quickly gets to a sturdy surface layer. Aroma is some grainy malt and hints of corn husk and caramel with some grassy hops and just a hint of pine sap. First sip reveals an average body with very mild, smooth, rolling carbonation. Texture is soft and silky on each sip.The beer really caresses my palate. The flavor is as nose advertises with some grainy malt going to caramel. Then come the hops, grassy and pine again come into play and bitter up my mouth a little, but actually give back to a husky grainy finish.

Pours tawny amber brown (Yuengling-ish?) with a poofy, rocky, eggshell-tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a bit of lace. Decent look. Smell is a sucker punch in the nostrils. Not sure what I was expecting from this brew, but the nose was a big surprise. Overhwelmingly bitter and floral, with caramel sweetness singing backup. Maybe I should start believing some of the hype about cans preserving the beer so well. As surprising as the pungency of the smell was the incongruity of the flavor profile. Just plain uninteresting in contrast to the huge nose- a dash of floral hops, not a ton but enough to outweigh the barely-there malt backbone. Out of balance and generally weak. Seems like some soft, mellow bitterness evolves once the beer is gone. In fact, I think I enjoy this beer more after the swallow. Decently smooth and inoffensive, but not worth a second visit.",1278794319
5.4,10785,1075,Ashland Amber,American Amber / Red Ale,4.5,4,4,4,jkrich,4,"12 oz. can with no freshness date: poured a deep and clear reddish to brown with ruby highlights. The creamy, tan head quickly recedes. The aroma is spicy and syrupy with some faint hop odor. The first sip emphasized malty sweetness with a faint bite of hops mixed in. There is a very slight licorice flavor in the aftertaste that is pleasing. The mouthfeel is actually a little thick and chewy with the sweetness keeping the palate coated. All the same, the ale remains refreshing with a zesty carbonation. This is a good, malt-accented amber ale that maintains good balance. I was surprised to see this along with the pale ale in Louisville, KY. It is the most I have ever paid for a six-pack, but it is worth trying.",1276469893

The aroma is a mix of light and juicy citrus with cocoa bread malt. That same barley character holds over into the flavor with a mix of pepper and lemon peel. The bitter aftertaste is a touch earthy and balances the sweet malt nicely. It's not the most flavorful, but at the same time the body is on the lighter side, making for a drinkable amber. Overall, a respectable session beer.",1275171065
5.4,10785,1075,Ashland Amber,American Amber / Red Ale,4,4,4.5,4,indiapaleale,4,"Pour - fills this glass with an amazingly colorful auburn liquid with some flashes of ruby red and bright orange with a big thick batter-like off-white head on top. Aroma - bread dough, caramel, apple butter, raw sugar, cocoa and some slight citrus. Smells great. I can't wait to move on to the best part of all of this. Taste - big malty, biscuity, bready sweetness hits the palate immediately. This may be a simple recipe but it sure has been perfected. This has the perfect balance of maltiness and some citrus hops to balance things out. The malt profile is something I am really enjoying, I'm not sure how best to describe it. I'd have to say its somewhere between honey butter and brown sugar cinnamon Pop-Tarts. Well, maybe not that sweet but it is surely delicious. Overall - great amber ale, one that I could definitely enjoy in multiple amounts. I love the flavor that this imparts and the great balance that it has with the PNW hops used. Amber Ales may not be my favorite style but this is proof that I could love any beer if its brewed well. Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. I wish I had access to Caldera out here but its also nice to know that its a regional brewery and I'll be sure to stop in to the brewpub if I am ever in Ashland again.",1272594505

A - a ruby colored ale, excellent clarity w/ 3fingers of light beige cap w/ mix of bubbles sized large and tiny. The lace clings very well and retention is good. The color reminds me of cranberry juice which is attractive to look at in the light S - A sweet toasted grainy odor w/ light fruitiness and berry-like yeast ester w/ a mild hop aroma and slight caramel notes w/ gentle vegetal aroma M - a moderately carbonated brew w/ mild bitterness and gentle sweetness. The texture has light toasted and spice aspects w/ dry finishing medium body overall T - the flavor is relatively biscuity upfront and has subtle pine notes from the hops w/ light creamy caramel malt taste. There is a gently fruity element from the yeast which allows the toasted grain note to carry over and seems to be the focus from midpoint on. the toast or roasted notes are the focus w/ mild herbal and the fruity quality adding contrast. The spice tinges mellow and a very light citrus in the hops comes out when warmer w/ another layer of flavor unfolding. The contrast makes the amber very balanced but seems to lean toward malt ever so slightly w/ strong biscuit taste until the semi-dry finish D - A solid beer in every way, very good representation of the style w/ satisfying drinkability. I would drink this with barbecue or meatloaf. The drinkability is good and I would look for this again I Can guarntee that (wink, wink)",1271703926

Now, for those may be arriving late to today's program, already well in progress, I not only review the beers, but I also transcribe the verbiage so that you do not have to. I thought that Ska was very clever: It's [Modus Hoperandi] label read: ""Walk, Kite, Recycle, Hide, Seek, Plant, Recycle, Grow, Shower, HHH, Tube, Recycle."" But now, from this one's exterior: "" 'Live Product. Keep Cool. Just Like You."" Yeah, man. How many times have my students heard me say, ""Be cool, baby. Be real cool.""? Innumerable. A ring around the neck read ""Go Biking ... Go Rafting ... Go CANS! ... Go Skiing ... Go Fishing ... Go Snowboarding ... www.calderabrewing.com"". It reminds me of the joke of the financially strapped male children looking for something to do on a hot summer's day. They pool their limited resources and send one of their number to the local grocer's, only to have him return with a box of tampons. Incredulous at this purchase, one of them inquires as to his choice. His response: ""Well, the box reads, 'With this product, you can go swimming, camping, fishing and a whole host of fun activites'."" Har! Yeah, me, I'm going to skip all of that fun stuff with the exception of ""Go CANS!"" Here we go, CANS, here we go! A friend of mine in the industry remarked that he feels that the days of generic ""Amber"" beers have passed. I disgree, but let's see how this stacks up. The finger-and-a-half of head was light-tan with good retention. Remember that ""Live Product"" jazz? Well, it had a slight haze to its deep-amber color suggestive of the presence of yeast. CAN-conditioned?!? Holy Drop the Corks and Cages, Batman! Gee, the nose smelled nothing like an amber of yore. Instead, I got a whiff of piney hops, a scent of malty sweetness, even a slight black pepper smell. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a caramel-malt taste that I would expect on the tongue. The finish, however, was both piney and peppery on the extreme, lingering finish. Initially, I got the same caramel sweetness, but it became overwhelmed. Yow!

Fruity notes here and there help with the complexity but keep the flavors from becomming as clean as they could be. A bit disjointed in texture because of the unattenuated sugars leaving a film on the mouth. But also shooting for dryness with the sharp bittering hops which cause too much of a bite going past the throat. Still malty throughout with grain flavors and textures late. Again a nice but ordinary Amber. The hop bitterness doesn't seem to be supported with the pleasant hop flavor or aroma, and allows the hops to bite too much. Those who like sweeter, English-style ales may find this one appealing. Reminds me a lot of Anerson Valley Boont Amber. Thanks BlueOkie!",1248142254
5.4,10785,1075,Ashland Amber,American Amber / Red Ale,4,3.5,4,4.5,BuckeyeNation,4,"Polished kumquat with crystalline clarity. The look and sound of the pour suggests that the mouthfeel will be excellent. Three fingers of thick and creamy foam sit atop the beer and look damn good while doing so. Large sheets of Swiss cheese-like lace stick to the glass. The nose has a bit too much toasted-nutty-earthy malt for my liking, but then that's what makes Ashland Amber an amber ale rather than an APA. The Cascade and Galena hops aren't as prominent as they are in this brewery's Pale Ale and IPA, but then that's what makes Ashland Amber... Leave it to Caldera to give Ashland Amber more hops than beer of this style usually sees. Maybe that's why I like their stuff so much. Malt (pale and crystal) has not been slighted. It tastes and feels like there's a considerable amount of barley present, especially for the ABV. Specifics include steely caramel, roasted peanuts, bitter black tea leaves and a prodigious shaving of grapefruit peel. The beer is balanced in terms of malt flavor vs. hop flavor, but bitterness supercedes sweetness at all points along the way. This is well-crafted beer that is a pleasure to drink. All things considered, the mouthfeel really is excellent, as the visual and auditory cues said it would be. It's full and lush for the style and the ABV, which makes it the highlight of an already enjoyable experience. Hey guys, can you teach other brewers how to do what you do? Although I'd take Caldera Pale Ale and Caldera IPA over Ashland Amber any day of the week, this is a wonderfully hoppy amber ale that just about any craft beer lover should enjoy. I would dearly love to have easy access to these brews.",1248004066

Appearance is a very reddish and bright body with a soapy head that quickly fades to a light scum around the edges of the glass. Aroma is biscuit-y at first, with some hops around the edges of the malt aroma...""balanced"" came to mind as a descriptor. Flavor is mostly malty, but has a nice mellow caramel character and some metallic-ness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Pretty good, but not exactly a knock-out.

Poured from the can into a pint glass... Appearance: For an amber, the color seems off as it is just a pretty plain coppery color with a nice, clear body -- I guess I would expect at least some ruby-esque highlights in there, if not a strong amber body...; light carbonation; one finger slightly off-white head that fades to a nice thick skim and very sparse lacing that's very thin. Smell: Mild, rassy smelling hoppy aroma with some lightly toasted malts; something seems amiss in the nose though and it's got a bit of rotted vegetative scent that reminds me of cabbage. Not a good start, but there have been other times where I've smelled something similar in ambers and haven't been let down by the flavor so I'm optimistic. Taste: Mostly getting the toasty malts and some of the mildly bitter hop presence, but not much else overall it's very mild... Not bad, but I have definitely had much more flavorful ambers that rate much higher than this. Mouthfeel: Body is thin and water and a little flat; finsih is wet and is like drinking malt flavored water. Drinkability: Overall, it's not hard to drink, but there's not much reason to do so. The flavors are mild and meek, the body is super watery and doesn't offer much, so I don't feel I will be drinking this again.",1246803927

Smell: Light malt iwth a hint of floral hops and not much more. Disappointing.

This retains down into a big creamy dollop, which leaves a sticky latticework of lacing back. The aroma is very fresh, spicy, and floral smelling (maybe a touch of more herbal qualities as well), with some fuller notes of tropical fruits and bready malts mixing in nicely. The taste starts with a light-moderate spicy bitterness with a solid backbone of citrus and toasted caramel imparting a sharp tang, before fading into a lingering dry and spicy feel. The hops profile that is present really is all about the spice. The mouthfeel is lighter-medium bodied with a VERY easy carbonation in the mouth. Maybe a bit too easy. While it's not quite watery, it does appear to be a bit thin in spots. Not enough to really hurt the quaffable nature of this though. I liked this. One of the more fuller flavored and easy drinking Ambers that I've had recently. This was another solid canned offering form Caldera.",1245431093

Toasty malts, along with a strong and sharp, but very herbal, hop aroma. More toasted malts along with a lot of sweet caramel. The hop flavor is very tea like, not giving strong citrus characteristics. Full bodied, with maybe slightly below average carbonation. I feel like this one could almost be called an Irish Amber Ale just from the flavor characteristics, especially from the hops. It's certainly a unique Amber Ale, especially one coming from the east coast. Rather than a load of sharp citrus, there is a softer herbal quality. Recommended.",1244397434

The nose has hints of milk chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and oak. In my opinion that is the best nose composition a porter can have. The beer has a medium body and mild carbonation. As it moves across the pallet a strong flavor of dark chocolate hits your tongue with light hints of coffee and bittering acids. Caldera is known for their love of hops and this beer is no different but the hops add to the beers complex flavor profile.

The finish is smooth and full with bourbon. Bourbon flavor deftly asserts itself without being overpowering or intrusive. The presence of alcohol is also handled well here because alcohol flavors are not detectable. M: Medium viscosity with low to moderate carbonation. This beer is very smooth and gently warming on the palate. While a heavier texture would not be out of place here, nothing about the mouthfeel of this beer is wrong. D: This beer is both drinkable and delicious. Despite its spirit-infused imperial pedigree, the palate is not fatigued over the course of drinking a glass. Compared to a Ballast Point bourbon barrel-aged Victory at Sea sampled recently, this beer is more drinkable but less extravagantly flavored (and likely also lower in abv).

A: pours a bright tawny hue with mixture of fine and huge bubbles in action, topped with a lingering white fluffy head. S: upon the opening, a whiff of skunky note escapes from the bottle, albeit not pungent; in the glass, the aroma has resinous notes of hops, sweet/syrupy orangey citrusness, and intensity of nectar (due to the honey?) all coming before a lighter performance of biscuity malts... a swirl gives rise to a rather focused and clean flow of spicy-floral touch of English hops on top of the settled citrusness (a bit like Challenger to me). T: the taste is yeasty, earthy and slightly grassy from the start (in a pleasant way), carrying with it a ""settled"" pale ale maltiness (with hints of raw-ish grains) and lightly sour-sweet citric+honey flavour; gradually, the latter two elements (sort of) intertwine to result in a clean palate of lingeringly aromatic honey-malty aftertaste, leaving ample space for the moderate-level hop bitterness with its tangy-citric edge to develop quietly at the back of the palate. M&D: not bad in terms of bottle-conditioning, as shown by the refreshing (but not sharp) carbonation and a sound body that stays intact throughout the drink; somehow the honey is perhaps (too) well-consumed and leaves little trace in the beer, as compared with malts and citric hops, dragging down the performance a bit if one looks to have adequate honey pleasure of any form in his glass (like me).

To be honest, for a big beer like this, the nose is pretty mellow. T: There's a decent bitterness on the palate along with some citrus hop flavor.

At least I got to see The Roots for the 38th time. A- Amstel Light lives up to its name having a very light pale yellow body that looked thinner than me at the time. A thin white cap stood on top for a few but it had no legs, hence no lacing. S- Amstel does not smell like much and whats there is not inviting. Old grain with a light toast to it. A very light malt addition and even less when it comes to hops and a bit of corn in the back. When it warmed this smelled downright skunky. T- The smell on this pretty much sums up the taste as well. Grain, malt, and just a touch of bitterness on the end. Some yeast comes out but does not enhance the flavor. A taste of corn has me thinking this is a glorified american macro, even though im being very generous with the word glorified. M- Thin, light and watery with a big blast of carbonation. Swishing this in the mouth really brings out the grain bill. They were not lying when they said this was a light lager. D- The ABV on this was actually 1.5% less than what I thought it would be, now I see why people can drink the hell out of this at a bar or similiar setting, but I ask myself why, this stuff taste like impending doom. Amstel light is good enough if your trying to pass the time at a party that you dont want to be at in the 1st place, so it's got that going for it, but nothing else.",1246860601

The flavor is a yeasty concoction of cornmeal, with the ever-so-faint taste of leftover hops. Actually, a very appealing flavor considering its ""light"" label.

The brew was very pale gold or straw in color and didn't really have any visible carbonation. Aroma was of hay, wet grass with a slight spice note to it. Shortly after pouring the aroma was a little more bold than I would have thought. But once it settled it was more like a wet musty aroma. As expected the taste was rather light with somewhat of a grape flavor. Still getting a grain like taste as well. This finishes a little sweeter than I remember and without much of a hop finish. Mouth feel is extremely light which is nice for drinkability. But I don't find it really appealing for my type of session beer. Doesn't really appeal to me.

Appearance- Pours the lightest imaginable straw yellow... as clear as glass, this supports a two finger snow white head that crackles down to a nice, fat rim. Aside from the head's thickness, it's tinted water. No lacing to speak of. Smell- Immediately following my cracking the bottlecap, an acrid smell of adjuncts (corn and cereal grain) flew out of the bottle. In the glass, this combines with a cloying sweetness that struggles to add a bready malt profile. Taste- Sharp and pungent, the cereal notes collide with an awful mouth wrenching abomination reminiscent of stale hops and corn syrup. The finish is especially horrid. Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Even though the initial attack is aggressive and even biting, it very quickly eases up and becomes really smooth and soft... remaining so right through the swallow. Unfortunately, this doesn't save the beer from itself. It's a hard one to drink out of a glass, purposefully noticing all of its warts.

But I'll try to approach it with an open mind. Pours a clear, light golden with a modest white head after an assertive pour. Not a terrible looking beer, truth be told. The smell, on the other hand, is an unappealing melange of cooked, overripe vegetable skunkiness and sickly sweetness. In terms of taste, largely carbonated water blended with a weak presence of cereal-malt sweetness -- seems like corn for the most part -- with the most faint hint of weak hops. I guess I score this higher in terms of taste when compared with others of its ilk, especially the appalling Heineken Light (though, ironically, this tastes more like I'd imagine a 'Heineken Light' to taste like, though that's not much of a compliment either). Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy before going flat fairly quickly. Higher drinkability because it would be easy to put away a lot of these without feeling too many ill effects. But on the other hand, would you really want to? Seriously -- if you're calorie conscious and are just seeking to quench your thirst, drink water, seltzer, iced tea or diet soft drinks. Because if you really need a beer, it means you really like beer. Which means you want a beer that tastes like beer.

I knew that light travels faster than sound, and apparently so does smell. Almost instantaneous to the sizzling sound after prying the cap I could smell the stale, malty aroma with distinct skunk overcoat that is character of so many (dare I say all?) Dutch macro lagers. I know this bottle was hidden from light during it's journey from Amsterdam so I don't mean to say it's ""skunked"" so much as it just is (used as an adjective) ""skunky"" smelling. The beers acts the way a beer should, that is to say I could observe a stream of carbonation rise up the neck of the bottle once opened. The head is frothy (not enough bubbles to call soapy) but very, very frothy. The head clings tightly, coating the sides in a soapy, white residue. The colour isn't quite generic - it's a dusty, sandy colour. Even more unattractive than bland. The mouthfeel is immensely creamy (more so then some of the CO2 induced, widget cans). The texture doesn't even closely resemble that of any other style beer (except perhaps the Guinness cans). Alongside the overly creamy texture is very low carbonation - and for these reasons the beer certainly doesn't quench. The mouthfeel might not hinder the beer so much if it weren't for the fact that it has no taste either. While the mouthfeel/texture remind me nothing of beer, the taste does little better. Any malt is difficult to pick out and placing it within a style according to its flavour would lead me to associate it only with non-alcoholic offerings.

MacSmack VIII puts on its traveling shoes and pits Amstel Light against Beck's Light in a titanic clash of European lightweights. Medium amber with several vigorous bubble streams leading up to an eggshell white crown that actually looks pretty good. This beer is a bit darker than Beck's and its head is darker as well; more cream than bright white. A little lace ends up sticking to the glass. The nose is of husky grain with a whiff of hops (that I don't think I'm imagining). It's the more powerful and the better of these two. Keep in mind that 'powerful' and 'better' are strictly relative terms. This is not good beer. Too many light lagers are flavor deficient. However, when they aren't, and they taste like this, I wish they were. Amstel Light tastes more like a BMC product than I would have thought possible. The flavor profile consists of stale grain with an artificial quality that causes that telltale sign of bad beer... the involuntary grimace. When I can't keep the corners of my mouth from turning down, I know that I've entered the land of the truly wretched. In terms of mouthfeel, each beer's positive is canceled out by its negative. This one has a slightly more full mouthfeel, relatively speaking, but a much fizzier carbonation. Let's call it a draw and move on. I didn't expect much from Amstel Light in spite of the fact that it's 'the #1 imported light beer in America'. Actually, that last sentence would be more accurate if I changed 'in spite of the fact that' to 'since'.

To date, Amstel Light (all 95 calories per 12 oz serving worth), is the best most beerlike light beer I have had. I include cheater Sam Adams Light (they stretch the definition of ""light"" with like 125 calories vs I think 150 for a regular bottle of Boston Lager) in that statement. Appearance is kind of odd because on the one hand it has a nice deep brown color, but on the other it is obviously a little watery looking, the result being that dark brown color is nearly transparent. It does manage to maintain a surprisingly stable head for a light beer. Smell is pleasant, you know hoppy, a bit of malt, a bit of yeast, basically what a normal beer is supposed to smell like. Taste is quite good. Some sweet malt, balanced presence of hops that are of decent quality, if not too exciting. A little yeast is in there too, and obviously this is a very clean tasting beer. Mouthfeel IS a bit on the watery side, but not to the point where you actually think you are drinking water whenever you take a sip without looking right at the glass. Drinkability is excellent since not only does this beer taste pretty good, but it obviously does not weight you down, plus you're packing on fewer calories and not getting as drunk either. Is this going to fool you into thinking you just drank an oatmeal stout, an extra bitter, or a dopplebock? Of course not. It is still a bit on the watery side in fact. But it does a better job of hiding the fact that its a light beer than any other I've tried yet. And that slighty watery liquid at least has some real beer flavor present, if not as much richness as even I would like. Take it from me, you are not likely to find a better light beer in a regular bar.

Yup, sour grains... that's about all I'm getting. No aftertaste really. Mouthfeel is really weak. Undercarbonated for a light lager, needs a little boost to compensate for the pure water of the texture. The watery feel probably correlates with how clear this beer is.

Maybe it wouldn't be skunky under other circumstances, but I feel that enough of these taste this way that I'm not rating an ""off"" sample. Even rated within the style this still has problems. Even though it's watery and low-alcohol, I couldn't drink many more due to the sourness.",1129670833

This brew went from an ice-cold can to a clear plastic cup to my stomach before it had any chance to get too warm. Amstel Light had a clear, bubbly yellow color with a fizzy, quick-fading white head. Lots of large bubbles rapidly rose to the surface but didn't keep the head alive long. The aroma was moderately sweet with overtones of grassy grains and herbal hops. Not too bad; average, considering some other light beers I'd had the misfortune to try. The taste was a bit disappointing as the malt profile never established itself. All I could taste was a lot of harsh herbal hops. The feel was light, prickly thanks to the overload of carbonation, and dry.

The aroma is very light, with mere traces of malt and hops, about what you'd expect from a light beer, but still disappointing. The flavor delivers a watered-down malt character that's incapable of asserting itself over the equally limp hops profile. There's definite notes of adjunct activity in the mix. The finish is rather bright considering what came before it, leaving an almost refreshing dry bitterness that lingers a bit. Very light bodied, it's pretty much the consistency of, you guessed it, water. It's overall presence in the mouth is minimal, though there is a lingering aftertaste from the understated hops. Neither good nor bad, this beer just is, really. It's so close to average that there's nothing to rip severely or recommend heartily. It is what it is, a light beer with more flavor than most other light beers. That alone gives it a leg up on the competition. And if it was the only beer offered me, I'd drink it, because in spite of it's mediocrity, or perhaps because of it, it is quite drinkable.

Somewhat of a soapy/musty smell that I have found in many light beers. The mouthfeel is not surprisingly thin and watery. The initial taste is of very light malt and light grains, and altogether the flavor reminded me of toasted grass (?!?!). Toss in the soapy taste too. Add water, and plenty of it. There is a hop bitterness present and is somewhat noticeable in the finish. This beer has just about no aftertaste, and no alcoholic warmth either. A no frills import. Amstel Light might have a little more taste than some domestic lights, but it fails to offer anything that would put it above that class as it is still quite watery.

If you can keep your nose close enough long enough, you start to notice a little maltiness and hops peek out of that skunk's ass. Then the skunk high-tails it into the flavor. After a few sips you get used to ol' Mr. Skunk and don't notice him as much and you realize that the commercials are right: it doesn't really taste as bland as most light beers. It's got some definite malt presence with some citrusy notes but it also has that unpleasantness (separate from the skunk) that Heinekin also has, but I can't place it exactly. Basically, I wish it was a light beer so it wouldn't be so damn hard to drink fast because it becomes near undrinkable when it starts to approach anything resembling warm.",1020954613

A little astringent grain in the middle. Hops are evident with a slight bite of bitterness. After taste is clean and seems to be the best part of the brew all together.

Pours a clear golden color with apparent carbonation, the head is a finger and goes away as fast as it comes. Aroma-wise? Not terrible. Water is predominant, but there's some light, sharp hoppiness and some bready malts. The taste? It starts out not too bad, it's fairly flavor deficient but has some nice subtle hop zings over some bready malt, but the finish comes in with a terrible metallic taste that basically ruins the whole thing. As it warms and my pallet becomes adjusted, this just tastes more and more like mineral water. The mouthfeel is nice, it's well-carbonated and prickly on the mouthfeel. The drinkability isn't great for a light beer, it tastes like it should be a bit heavier in ABV. Overall, this really isn't a great beer. It's servicable, but just barely. If it was the only thing available, I'd drink it and not complain too much. But picking this over the Yuengling and Stella in my parent's fridge was a mistake. Absolutely need a light beer?

It holds a fluffy two finger head, briefly, before it quickly recedes to a bubbly mist over the glass. No lacing is left, and no sediment is noted. There is maximal transparency, and carbonation appears to be very high. The aroma is wrought with adjuncty grain. There is also a sticky sweetness present, along with an offensive coiny metal and floury graininess. The taste profile is initiated with sour adjuncty grain. Through the middle there is a slight fruity vibe, perhaps of sweeter lime, or of the lemony variety. From here we transition to a finish that highlights adjuncty grain, and little else. The aftertaste follows suite with more bitter adjuncts, and a boringness of corn. The body is light, and the carbonation is medium to high.

5,1414,163,Amstel Lager,Euro Pale Lager,3,3,3,3,biegaman,3,"This lager needs no Photoshop, it should require no help doing its own commercials and billboards; a clear golden body absorbs the light like a sponge and spits it out far and wide in the form of bright, refulgent rays. Its head is pristine white and even manages to inscribe the glass. Amstel is wise to stay away from the green glass bottles; it's no coincidence that this smells cleaner than most Dutch export lagers. The aroma is faint but heavy on the bready notes, like stepping into a bakery, with corn grits playing only a negligible role. It doesn't smell very appetizing but at least it's easily recognizable as beer - and not corn syrup or skunk. The taste is almost non-existent which would likely make it agreeable to mainstream drinkers. I admit I find it somewhat refreshing. It is, by most accounts, a thoroughly average beer in the sense that its flavour is grainy-sweet and ordinary, free of bitterness, and the presence of adjunct flavour light, far from off-putting, but still a little perceptible. Frankly, Amstel does nothing for me. I've had plenty of swill lagers like it, both better and worse, and a bland, mainstream beer like this doesn't offer me anything new. It has no character to distinguish it; there's nothing that set's it apart from its competitors (except that it lacks the foul adjunct tinge of some). Still, I won't go so far as to say it's a ""bad"" beer... Of all the beers I had in Holland, the pint of Amstel I had after a hot summer day of walking through Amsterdam for the first time is still one of the most memorable - and not memorable for the wrong reasons. It was cold, clean, ordinary and refreshing - what more could I ask of it? It would be far from the best beer I had that trip, but it did the trick when called upon.",1313968846

Taste: confirmed the aroma, with a tendency toward the malt. Mouthfeel: smooth, good carbonation, low alcoholic strength, very light body.

I had to smell this one several times to try to experience it. T Very grainy, barley. After repeated sips it kind of fell into a category of a standard Pilsener. Nothing too exciting here.

Amstel's Herfstbock carries the opidome of flavors that are best represented in authentic German Bockbiers. Dry toasty malt flavor and feel chase the beer from initial aromas to it's malty-dry finish. Medium to heavy toast are the perfect complemnts to rich walnut and burnt caramel malt flavor. But without the associated sweetness from malt, the beer instead relies on smooth savory lager flavors of caramelized starch and caramel for a nearly meaty taste. Full bodied to start, the beer's lager-like character takes hold with a fully attenuated dryness but without astringency or unnecessary bite. Low in bitterness, hops aren't needed to balance the toasty malt body and finish. Delicious throughout and a fine complement to kebabs and smoked gouda.",1322665333

I had never had an ESB at this point, and didn't really know what the hell it was. Well, the Cumberland in Louisville brewed one and I tried it, and shrugged. It was lighter, but I preferred thier pale and nitro porter. So my friend and I were in the Broad Ripple, and I had thier dark beer, but he had the ESB because he was more experienced with beers. He said I should get one, so I did. That was it. I locked into it and drank nothing else when I went to the Broad Ripple. Period. It was the best ESB that I compared all others too. This past weekend, five years with two years of being a BA later, I found myself at the Broad Ripple and ordered the holy grail of ESB's and well, it wasn't as wonderful as I remembered, but then, as I sipped, it became again, a great beer in my book. It had a good head that stayed with the beer and was a cloudy yellow-grey appearence, almost like a mead. There was not much to smell, but the grains used. Not as pungent as a wheat or Hefe. Mouth was watery, not much bite, washed down clean with good foam , it was also served near room temperature. Taste was, well, very decent. It wasn't as hoppy as some American ESBs, it had a mild flavor with a slight bitter wash, but what made this beer was the flavor of the grains used. I could almost pick out the elements in this beer, and imagined that if I ordered an ESB in a bar in England, this is the pint I'd get. Very nice.

We will see how time treats this one. I am hopeful.",1216868440
10.1,41524,694,Scratch Beer 8 - 2008,Tripel,4,3.5,2.5,3,younger35,2.5,"Received this brew from BeerTruth in a recent trade. I've had Scratch 1-7 and they've sorta been hit and miss so lets see what we get here. Drank from my Stone India Pale Ale tulip. Appearance- Pours a light straw yellow with a soft one finger white head that disappears fairly quickly leaving a spotty cap. A decently sized collar is left leaving tiny bits of spotty lacing. Smell- Very spicy and lightly floral nose that is apparent upon opening. Light ginger, coriander and I'm assuming the aroma that I can't place is the Yarrow Flower. Never had a beer with Yarrow in it (that I know of anyway). Malt is very present as well with a light honey sweetness and boozy finish. Taste- Very spicy from the start and that gin like influence is evident. The coriander is strong and there is a big berry presence that for some reason doesn't strike me as Juniper. Strong malty sweetness that is a little overbearing and plenty of yeast that is lightly dirty and funky. White pepper and clove are the majority of the spiciness around some light banana. Plenty of alcohol in the finish and although I think the spices are too much, I think the booziness really takes away from the beer more. A lingering banana and clove sweetness hangs around for quite some time. Mouthfeel- Thick and syrupy with a very cloying sweetness, plenty of zesty carbonation and loads of warming. Drinkability- Like I said earlier there is a bit to much spice and sweetness in this brew for my liking. They yeast is very Tripel but the rest of it is just too much for a enjoyable brew. I said these brews seem to be hit or miss and this one is a miss for me. Big thanks to Adam for the opportunity!",1214789265

Smell: yeast with some big honey and fruit sweetness. Very pleasant on the nose. Taste: nice malt profile with honey, ripe berries, yeast, and some mild spiciness. Alcohol is noticeable and warming. Bitterness comes through nicely despite the sweetness. Mouthfeel: light prickliness at the start but smooth at the finish. Very long aftertaste as the flavors seem to linger in the mouth for quite a while. Medium-heavy bodied beer. Drinkability: the sweetness and alcohol levels make this a slow sipper, but enjoyable throughout the entire glass.",1213270039

Cloudy golden appearance with very little head to speak of and virtually no lacing...appears rather thick.. Very nice aromas of that funky Belgian yeast, some sort of candied fruit (perhaps peach?), a faint hoppiness, and perhaps some brown sugar...I don't smell any booze at all.. Sweet candied fruits covered with brown sugar and maple syrup.... That's what I'm getting and its delicious...finishes a little spicy with some cinnamon or cloves, maybe even some nutmeg... Like a banana nut bread that's had a good brandy poured over it. Delicious... This was my first Scratch brew and I enjoyed the heck out of it.. It was sweet and delicious and a terrific sipper after dinner tonight..",1213145003

Aroma of pear, juniper and bubble gum is quite intense but very enjoyable. Taste is a mix between a typical Belgian triple with some excellent notes of juniper, pear and bubblegum. Body is quite full with some average carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I really enjoyed this one even though the aroma and spicing is too intense to drink this regularly.",1212691423

The coriander was evident on the nose. The color was a cloudy lemon-yellow. The mouthfeel was medium with a very black-peppery taste on the tongue. The finish was dry and even a little hot. It was good, but one or two at a sitting would be plenty.",1212448929

Smell: Pale malt aroma with notes of banana, spice, yeast, flowers, and yarrow. Ah, Yarrow, my old friend digs up an Allagash Fluxus flashback. Taste: Pale malts with a hit of sweet candi sugar. Splash of pear juice. Sour yeastiness. Hint of fresh, sliced bananas. Mild juniper berry character, but, then again, I've never had a beer infused with junper berries that really knocked me out of my seat with juniper flavor. I'm not really getting much hoppiness out of this thing. Lightly spicy and the distinct yarrow taste. A little peppery on the sweetish, yeasty finish. Mouthfeel: A hair above medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: Another fun, fine experiment from the Tregs Scratch series, though I've never been particularly wild about additions of yarrow to beer.",1212437126

The gin/juniper berries is very apparent and couples nicely with the honey. The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, with juniper berries imparting almost a gingerale flavor with the honey. The beer has moderate sweetness, which once again plays nicely with the juniper. The beer actually seems fairly light on the palate, and it's hard to believe the abv. is 10%. The finish is long and smooth. Another excellent scratch beer from Troegs.",1210979478
10.1,41524,694,Scratch Beer 8 - 2008,Tripel,3.5,4,2.5,2.5,BeerTruth,2.5,"number1bum hooked me up with this brew. Scracth 3 was decent, let's see how this one matches up. 12 oz. bottle poured into a chalice. Pours a foggy bronzed straw yellow with a half finger white head that quickly dies down to just about nothing. Very minimal spots of lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell consists of evergreen, granny smith apples, clove, and pepper. Very unique aroma, but seems to work out fairly well. Some banana bread in the nose as well, but that seems to be a given for the style. For 10.1% abv, I can't seem to find any boozey scent, that's always good. Taste begins with pine and lime, uhhh, intereseting. Clove, corriander, and dry pepper on the tongue with a big burning alcohol in the back of the throat towards the end. The booze flavor really takes away from this beer. The spices seem to be over the top as well. Thick and chewy full body with that leaves an alcohol coating in the mouth. Carbonation is subtle. Scratch 3 is good, no need to try another stab at a Tripel. Most of the Scratch beers have been quite enjoyable, but this one falls very short. I'm looking forward to trying more in the series. Thanks again Josh, you were definitely right about this one.",1210551884
10.1,41524,694,Scratch Beer 8 - 2008,Tripel,4,4.5,4.5,4,KarlHungus,4,"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of tangerine, orange, barnyard, and anise. The taste is funkier than the aroma with the barnyard yeast flavors up front. It is followed by citrus fruits with a hot alcohol presence in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very good American version of a Tripel. I would love to drink this again.",1210029175

Smells of apples, peppery spices, coriander, clove, citrus, banana, biscuits, and alcohol. Tastes of green apples with a lemony tartness followed by a sweet honey and wheat middle and clove and candied banana in the finish along with a firm alcohol presence. Medium full in body and low in carbonation, but does offer a nice tingle. Spicy, sweet, and alcoholic. A good tripel, but is really powerful, definitely a sipper.",1209593867

Poured a deep, dark, almost opaque brown with very little head and almost no lacing. Smells sweet, and fruity caramel notes. Again, i get the caramel taste, and fruit, most notably dark cherries and some rich apples. I dont really taste the high ABV, other than the alcohol sweetness.

S- Dark Fruit soaked in alcohol. Mildly sweet. T- A bit sweet. A bit spicey. A tiny bit of nuts and apricot in the middle of all that alcohol soaked dark fruitiness. M - This is a pretty full bodied beer. The low hop and low carbonation leave a long lingering array of flavors. D - Big beers are never as drinkable to me. I tend to like them more but drink them less. At 10+% and a very tongue engrossing flavor this is a nice bottle to share once in a while, not an everyday kind of thing.",1248197738

M- Full body with a fairly low carbonation. D- Pretty straightforward in its malty sweetness.

A beige head of moderate size results from a vigorous pour, starts to recede fairly quickly. Smell is quite fruity- cherry, raisin. Toffee or caramel is present as well, slightly reminiscent of a caramel apple. Brown sugar. Faint cocoa scents and some Belgian yeast. Good smell. Not as strong as I would have expected. Taste is a bit of a surprise. Fruit flavours are lighter than expected (in flavour, not intensity). I can taste strawberry pretty clearly along with the raisin and plum flavours that are more expected. A bit of a bubble-gum flavour as well. Caramel flavour is present and very nice. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden- only a slight bit of heat. A little bit of spice. Excellent. Mouthfeel is very good. Moderate to low carbonation level, very smooth. Nice full body.

T: Sweet dark fruit up from, grapes and prune, some more molasses, and some pepper and clove spice. M: Medium to full bodied with light carbonation. Sweeter than expected with a slightly dry finish. O: A pretty good beer, not I would expect otherwise from Unibroue. While I liked it, I probably wouldn't grab it again. Might be the style as most Belgian Strong Dark Ales don't grab me.",1321562717

There is an inch of cream colored head. Spotty lacing. Then nose is bringing up a lot of dark fruits including cherries, plum, date, and a bit of apple. There is some caramel intertwined and there is a sweet biscuit-like malt involved as well. The taste has a nice subtle sweetness that melds all of the above fruit flavors together creating a nice treat. A cherry taste is mainly notice but there are also some plum and fig notes. The bread-like malt is noticed in the finish along with just a tad of caramel and clove. Then mouthfeel is syrupy and comfortably textured. The viscosity of this brew keeps the aftertastes flowing. Enjoyable. Overall, I think is a great Belgian Strong Dark Ale and the sweet characteristics are enjoyable without a cloying feel. Very nice.",1320649916

Big belgian yeast and toasted malt aroma. Brown sugar, fruit, brown bread, some spice, some light cocoa and bruised fruit. Big alcohol that leads to a dried out bitterness. Complex and delicious. Fuller bodied, moderate carbonation. An easy drinker, and dangerous at 10.5%. Very worth trying.

10.5,3635,22,La Terrible,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,4.5,4.5,4,4,jayhawk73,4,"Pours a dark brown with crimson highlights if held to the light. Beautiful coffee colored two finger head, which sticks around a bit, and slowly disappears to a sliver. Fig, clove, apple, and toast are what I pick up on the nose. It's not as complex as some of the best in this style (Belgians), but it's still very well done. The taste is nice- although pretty dry for my taste. The fruits, spices, toast all come through- but the beer is so dry they evaporate off my tastebuds and there's only a mild aftertaste left. None of the 10.5% alcohol is felt or noticed. Feel is a little thin and dry for what the best in this style brings. The flavor has potential, it just never really gets to open up IMO... Overall, a very good beer- but not quite up to the Rochefort 8's, Cuvee de Kaiser Blau on the style list. Still, this is a totally solid brew, and just a few minor changes away from straight 4.5's.

Nice yeastiness. Good spice notes. Not quite the big nose that I was expecting. Again, this one is pretty subdued, which is not what was expected. Good malty backbone, with a fairly big yeastiness coming over the top of it. Nice spice notes. Mild notes of figs and dark fruits. Light touch of brown sugar. Not very complex, but a tasty brew, nonetheless. Almost full-bodied. Most of my enjoyment was killed by the high level of carbonation. It really gets in the way of everything else.
